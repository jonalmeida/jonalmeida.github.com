It works by lining up a chosen number with a specific (also chosen) point on a picture. This is a vague description because it isn't as easy to explain in words as it is to show.\nN4BB.com has a nice video showing how it works:\n\n\nWhat is really neat about this is, unlike other picture or pattern password locks on other platforms, you can't as easily figure out the password the old fashioned way -  sneaking a look over the other person's shoulder.\nI'm not crazy, honest\nYou're going to think I'm a bit of a whack job when I try to explain the value of this, but bare with me. Some of my points might seem unlikely, but if a sleep-deprived manic like me can figure out the security pattern on your device by simple observation, I'm sure anyone can.\nWhere other platforms fall short\nIf we look at the Android pattern method, it seems like a neat idea - create a complicated pattern from a 3x3 matrix. I'm not willing to do the math, but you can tell there are plenty enough combinations available to make it uniquely secure enough for an average user. Let's just assume you can't have a large matrix for now.\nWhere the Android device fails, is it requires you to re-create the same pattern every time at the same location on your screen. This might seem nonsensical to some, but it's fairly easy to figure out someone's pattern when they've unlocked their phone. Having a quick peek, will show the green line trace of the pattern while its being drawn out.\nAlright, so you have a custom ROM which let's you turn off the tracing so that others around you can't see it. Another way, assuming you've got a hold of the person's device by now, is by the smudge marks from the person's finger that shows the path of the unlock pattern. In fact, I've even figured out a friend's Android unlock pattern using this method just to prove this point to them.\n\nI tried to take a picture of what I'm struggling to explain; you can see in the image on the right that there is a faint smudge of my finger from my last attempt to unlock my device. However, it's much more evident than what you can see from the image and I've kept my pattern simple to make it easy to show.\nIf I remember correctly, Windows 8 implemented the same feature, but with a larger matrix. That's great and all, but now the password get's complicated and destroys the ease that initially came with it.\nWindows 8 had also tried another take on this - instead of using set points to draw your personal security pattern, you get to make your own pattern across a picture of your choice. But once again, they too fall short because you're left with the same problem. You can connect the dots, but you can potentially leave behind a fingerprint trace.\nThe way it should work\nEnter BlackBerry's Picture Password.\nIt just needs you line up a number to a set point on a picture- this doesn't seem too trivial. Surely you can figure it out some way? The catch is, a grid of numbers is placed above the picture in a random order (with repetitions) like an overlay between two pictures. Now you have to line up your number (which is randomly placed) to that point and you don't even have to place your finger over that number as well. You move the grid, like your scrolling on a mobile touchscreen browser.\nWith this method of security, you aren't giving up your number or the selected picture point since the overlooker won't be able to match one with the other.\nI jokingly bet with another friend that I could unlock my phone in front of him a hundred times and he still wouldn't manage to figure the combination. Some time later, I found myself repeatedly re-locking my phone and holding a zombie finger above to unlock the device while he closely looked on. I wasn't keeping a score, but *cough* 65 tries *cough* later he gave up.\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/blackberry-picture-password/","title":"BlackBerry Picture Password is more secure than you think"},"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec02/":{"body":"I'm taking down notes for Sam Altman's class, How to Start a Startup and I figured I'd start sharing them. This is for the second lecture with the following notes:\nChoosing a co-founder\n\nDon't choose a random co-founder\nChoose someone you have a long history with\nWhen something goes really wrong, you have a past history that binds us together\nMeet a co-founder in college\nMeeting co-founder while working in a startup\nStarting a startup alone is STILL a bad idea\nModel for choosing a co-founder:\n\nLook for a person that behalves like \"James Bond\" rather than one that's an expert in a particular domain\n\n\nTough and calm co-founder IF you aren't.\nYou need a technical co-founder\nAverage number of co-founders: 2-3\nQ. How about co-founders that aren't working in the same location?\n\nDO NOT DO IT!\n\n\n\nHow to Hire\nDon't Hire\n\nFirst, try NOT to hire\n\nThe goal is not to hire for as long as possible\nE.g. Airbnb hired only two people in the first year, and took 5 months\n\n\nFind people who feel that they're apart of the founding of the company\nHire slowly and with a high hiring bar\n\nHow to ACTUALLY Hire\n\nRecruiting is hard, not everyone wants to join. It can take a year sometimes.\nIt's important to get the product right first\n\n\nIf you're going to join a startup, pick a \"rocketship\". Something that you know is going to be huge, but not everyone realizes yet.\n\n\nGood people wait to see if you're going to be a \"rocketship\"\nHow much should you spend hiring: 0% or 25%\n\nMediocre engineers do not build great companies\n\nThis can kill the company\nThey are needed to build the culture of the company\nIf you comprise in the first ~10 hires that may just kill the company\n\nWill I bet the future of the company on this single hire?\n\n\nWhen you're bigger, you will eventually comprise..\n\nSources of Candidates\n\n\nPersonal referrals for the first 100\n\n\nLook outside the SV, it's brutally hard to hire in SV\n\n\nExperience:\n\nExperience matters for some roles.\nEarly hires doesn't matter much, you need to look for aptitude.\nAre they smart? Do they get things done? Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?\n\n\n\nQ. How do you know if their initial in-experience is going to be okay when things scale up?\n\nPeople who are smart can almost always find a role in the company.\nMay need to move to a different role or team.\nGreat employees can move around easily and it's usually an issue.\n\n\n\nBest way to hire is to work with them to hire. Sometimes you don't need to even interview if you've worked on the same project together.\n\n\nCall references!\n\nIs this person in the top 5% of the people you've ever worked with?\nWhat specifically did you do?\nWill you hire them again? Why aren't you hiring them again?\n\n\n\nIf someone cannot communicate clearly, that's a BIG problem in the future that they'll work out\n\n\nSomeone who likes to take a bit of risk.\n\n\nThe Animal Test\n\n\"You should be able to describe any employee as an animal of what they do.\"\n\nYou need unstoppable people\n\n\nMark Zuckerberg said he likes to hire people:\n\nHe would spend time socially\nHe'd be comfortable reporting to if the roles were reversed (you need to have high respect for them).\n\n\n\nEmployee Equity\n\n\n10% to the first ten employees.\n\n\nDon't be stingy with equity to employees, investors only write the check.\n\n\nFight with investors to reduce the equity they get.\n\n\nQ. When should co-founders decide on the equity split?\n\nSet this very soon as you get started.\nIf you're not willing to give them equal shares, you should question if this is the right relationship?\n\n\n\n\"You shouldn't tell your employees they're fucking up everyday otherwise they will.\"\n\n\nLearn to praise your team, you need to give people more responsibility.\n\n\nDan Pink (TED) talk on Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose.\n\n\nUse one-on-ones.\n\n\nHow to Fire..\n\nEvery first-time founder waits too long\n\nIt's better for you, and them\n\n\nFire people who create office politics and always negative\n\nThese will kill a startup!\n\n\nQ. How do you balance firing people fast and make early employees feel secure?\n\nAnyone will screw up once or twice\nIf someone is getting every decision wrong, it's be blatantly obvious who these people are amongst others.\nIn practice, there's almost never any doubt.\n\n\nQ. What if you're relationship with a co-founder breaks down?\n\nYou have to have \"vesting\".\nPre-negotiate how this will play out before this ever happens.\nIn SV, it takes four years to earn all of that.\n\nE.g. If you leave after one year, you keep 25% of that, two years; 50%, etc.\n\n\nIf the company leaves with half the company, getting investments is VERY hard after that.\nTalk about it early, don't let it fester!\n\n\n\nExecution\n\nThe way to execute well is to execute it yourself.\nYou need to been executing tasks; creates company culture this way.\nPut in the effort\n\nJobs of a CEO\n\nSet the vision\nRaise money\nEvangelize\nHire and manage\nMake sure the entire company executes (!)\n\nCan you figure out what to do?\nCan you get it done?\n\n\n\nCan you get it done: Focus\n\nThere are several things that need your attention.\n\nYou need to figure which of the two or three tasks are the most important, get those done and differ the rest.\n\n\nSay no. A Lot.\nDon't work really hard on the things no one cares about.\nSet overreaching goals.\n\nThis is what the whole company focuses on then.\n\n\nCommunication\n\nYou can't be focused without really good communication.\n\n\nMaintain growth and momentum\n\nHave the right metrics and be focused on growing\n\n\nDon't get (the company) distracted or excited with other things (PR).\nWork together. Again, remote co-founders DO NOT WORK.\n\nCan you get it done: Intensity\n\nStartups can't give you a good work/life balance - that's the reality.\n\nThey're all consuming.\nYou have to be able to outwork your competitors.\nYou have to be intense (needs to come from co-founders).\n\n\nObsess with quality\n\nYou need to have a culture where people have high quality standards for everything the company does, but still move quickly.\nMove fast and break things.\nBe frugal in the right places, but care about quality everywhere.\n\"Don't buy people shitty computers, if you don't want them to write shitty code.\"\n\n\nBe decisive/Quick\n\nTalk about grand plans, but be biased towards action.\nIt lets you done in incremental pieces. In the end, you have a huge project completed.\n\n\nShow up\n\nGet on a plane in marginal situations. &lt;- This is good literal advice\n\n\nMomentum and growth are the life-blood of startups\n\nAlways keep momentum!\n\n\n\nGrowth\n\nWhen there's a disagreement among the team on what to do, you ask your users.\n\nStuff isn't working right now, we don't actually hate each other, we just need to get back on track.\n\n\nShipping a product\nLaunching a new feature\nReviewing/reporting metrics and milestones\n\n\nDon't worry about a competitor at all until they're actually beating you with a shipped product.

This is for the third lecture with the following notes:\nCounter-intuition in Startups\nIgnored PG's advice to not take down notes\n1. Don't trust your intuition\n\nStartups are counter intuition. It's one of the areas where you can't always trust your intuition.\nFounders generally ignored YC partners about mistakes they are about to make. Later coming back and saying, doh!\n\nWhy? Because they seem like they're wrong.\nTrust your instincts about people.\n\n\nPick people for business the way you would pick people as friends.\n\nLook for people you genuinely like and respect.\n\n\n\n2. Expertise in startups\n\nWhat you need to succeed in a startup, is not expertise in startups.\n\nYou take a french class to learn french.\nYou take a startup class to succeed is to understand your users.\n\n\nOne of the characteristic mistakes of young founders: going through the motions of starting a startup (SAS).\n\ni.e. renting a office, hiring some friends, BUT NOT understanding their users and making something users want.\n\n\nMotion of starting a startup was termed \"playing house\".\nCollege classes are as artificial as running laps.\n\"Growth hacks\" == \"Bullshit\"\n\n3. Gaming the system\n\nSAS is where gamging the system stops working\nGaming the system might work in bigger companies.\nIn startups, there's no boss to trick.\nUsers only care about, \"Does your software work?\"\n(Dangerous) Faking may work to for investors for a few rounds of funding\n\nInevitably, you're going to be wasting your time.\n\n\nSomeone who knows what users want but knows zero about fund raising is better off than someone that knows how to raise money but has a flat usage graph.\n\n4. Startups are all consuming\n\nStartups will take up your entire life\nLarry Page analogy:\n\nYou may envy him, but his life is all-encompassing around Google.\nHe can't go on holiday because of a backlog of decisions only he can make.\nAs the \"daddy\", he can't show fear or weakness\nBillionaire's can't complain about having a difficult life\n\n\nIn all successful YC companies, all founders say, \"It never gets easier\".\nSAS is like having kids?\nPeople seem to think that you should SAS in college.\n\nYou can't do this as a student because it takes up your entire life.\nWhich one do you do then? (Be a student or SAS?)\n\nHint: Don't do it in college. Period.\n20 is not an optimal age.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. You can't tell if you should SAS\n\nShould you do it at any age?\n\nYou don't know.\n\n\nIf you're terrified - don't do it.\nIf you're unsure - the only way to know, is to try.\nIf you want to do it now (20 year old). You need two things:\n\nAn idea\nCo-founders\n\n\n\n6. Do not try to think of Startup ideas\n\n(Read PG's article)\nIf you make a coscious effort to think of one, you end up with bad ideas.\nThe best way, is to step back.\nTurn your brain into the type that has startup ideas unconsciously.\nGoogle, Yahoo, Facebook all started as side projects.\nHow to turn your brain into the type that has startup ideas unconsciously:\n\nLearn a lot on things that matter\nWork on things that interest you..\n..with people you like and respect (this is how you get co-founders eventually)\nGet to the leading edge of technology where you \"live in the future\". Ideas that seem odd to others, see obvious to you.\n\n\nAirbnb founders were not techie's, they were guys that were good at organizing and got things done.\n\"You don't have to work on technology per se, so long as you work on things that stretch you.\"\n\nWhat kind of things are those?\nHistory shows young people working on things people thought weren't important. In particular, their parents as well. (Parents are also right sometimes).\nLong story short: PG doesn't know the answer for you, you have to find out what works for you on your own.\n\n\n\nRe-visiting: What can you do as a 20 year old?\n\nNot the new entrepreneurial part of college of SAS.\nInstead, the classical version of learning powerful things.\n\nGetting domain expertise. (Larry Page was genuinely interested at Search).\n\n\ni.e. Just.Learn.\n\nQ. How can a non-technical founder most contribute to a startup?\nAns. If the startup is working in a specific domain, the non-technical one would be the doing the main tasks of getting the company to work. The technical one would just be writing the interfaces to use it (i.e. Android or iPhone app).\nIf it was a technology startup, the non-technical founder does sales \"and brings coffee and cheeseburgers to the programmer\" (+1).\nQ. Do you see value in business schools for those who want to pursue entrepreneurship?\nAns. Nope. Business Schools (BS) was designed for management. You only have management in an already successful startup. BS are trying to be that, but aren't doing it right.\nQ. Management is only a problem if you're successful. What about those two or three people?\nAns. The first hires aren't people you need to \"manage\". You have to treat them are almost like founders. They should be motivated by the same thing as your startup.\nQ. Do you think we're currently in a bubble?\nAns. Non-valuable question\nQ. People start labs that are supposed to start startups. Does this seem like a good idea?\nAns. They quite possibly could, but you don't have your own money to start these things.\nQ. What advice do you have for female co-founders when you're pursing funding?\nAns. Female founders empirically have a harder time at raising funding.\n\nMake your startup do really well.\nGrowth graphs have no gender, so let VCs fall in love with that.\n\nQ. What would you (PG) learn in college right now?\nAns. Physics.\nQ. What are your recurring systems in your work and personal life that make you efficient?\nAns.\n\nHaving kids: you have no time left, so it forces you to focus because you have no choice.\nBeing forced to work with deadlines you can't avoid (which you have to sometimes create yourself).\n\nQ. When is it a good time to turn a side project into a startup?\nAns. You will know. When it starts to take up your entire life that you don't have time for anything else.\nQ. What to do when you have growth, but not very impressive one?\nAns. Read, \"Do things that don't scale\".\nQ. What are your strategies to figure out \"what matters\"?\nAns. If something (like technology) is spreading, anything on the edge is an interesting idea (i.e. bleeding edge).\nQ. If you hire people you like, you start to get a mono-culture. How do you avoid that?\nAns. The advantages that you know and like are far greater than the disadvantages of having a mono-culture.\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec03/","title":"How to Start a Startup - Lecture 3 Notes"},"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec04/":{"body":"I'm taking down notes for Sam Altman's class, How to Start a Startup and I figured I'd start sharing them.

your co-founder should be using it\nMum, dad, friends, etc.\nOnline communities: Show HN, Reddit, mailing lists, local communities.\nGuilt-trip people in your local communities to get them to use it the first time!\n\nWhat do you do with all these users?\n\nCustomer feedback:\n\nPhone number\n\nSetup voicemail\n\n\nEmail\nWhat you really need is to get out and go meet them\n\n\nSend out surveys:\n\nThis gets you the extremes (people who really like you, or really hate you)\nThe in-between requires you to get out\n\n\nDon't poke your users, \"why why why?\"\n\nThis is what you want -&gt; Socialize with your users at a human-level (take them out for drinks, coffee, etc.)\n\n\nTrack customer retention:\n\nPeople who came today, are they returning?\nCollect NPS (Net Promoter Score).\n\n\n\nEverybody lies\n\nFor a free product:\n\nMum: She will always be nice and give you a great review (least honest)\nAcquaintances: More likely to give you honest opinions\nRandom person (who doesn't know you): More honest, but don't care that much\n\n\nFor a paid product:\n\nMum: Still lies and says you're awesome\nAcquaintances: More likely to give you honest opinions\nRandom person: If they don't think the product they paid for was worth it, they're really going to tell you (Most honest)\n\n\nDoesn't mean you should make people pay when you first launch.\n\nIf you're going to make them pay eventually, get to the point where you do that really fast.\n\n\n\nPost-feedback/Pre-launch\n\nBuild fast, optimize for this stage of growth.\nDon't build features if you had a million, build for the first 10/100.\nYou don't need to automate everything:\n\nYou need to learn what should be automated and what shouldn't\ne.g. Some questions for cleaners applying could be asked online, but some interviewing questions needed to be done in-person\n\n\nTemporary brokenness is better than permanent paralysis\n\nDo not worry about all the edge cases\nWorry about the generic user first\nAs you start to scale, the edge cases become more and more clearer\n\n\nBeware of \"Frankenstein\" approach:\n\nWith all the feedback, you build it the next day and try to make them happier.\nWhen someone asks you to build a feature:\n\nGet to the bottom of why they're asking the feature\nThere maybe a root solution that would otherwise be hidden with all these features\n\n\n\n\n'S' is for stealth and stupidity\n\nDon't be worried about imitators, that will always be the case\nDon't let it stop you from launching\n\n\n\nReady for a lot of users?\n\nFocus only on one channel for growth at a time:\n\nDON'T be tempted to do many at once.\nTry one channel for a week, move to the next\n\nIf it fails, move to the next\n\n\n\n\nChannels always change (e.g. Facebook ads, Google ads)\n\nAlways optimize for that\n\n\nGo back to the failed channels and try to re-visit\nThree types of growth:\n\nSticky: Trying to get your existing users to pay you more\nViral: User uses your product, likes it, and tells their friends about it.\nPaid: If you have money in the bank, you buy users.\n\n\n\nSticky Growth\n\nYou need to deliver a good experience, people will want to keep using you\nTo measure this, you need to look at the CLVs and Retention Cohort analysis\n\nCustomer Life Time: How much a customer revenue gives you over a time period (6 months, 12 months, etc.)\nRetention Cohort analysis: (graph in the video explaining this bit at 35:10)\n\n\n\nViral Growth\n\nLike Sticky, you need to deliver a good experience, but you need to develop a REALLY good experience\nYou need a good referral program:\n\nWhere are people going learning that they can refer other people?

(e.g. 3 years until you start growing)\n\nBuild what you need to to get 1 user, then 4 users, etc.\nIf you're doing this, and you go three-four weeks with no growth, you're probably doing something fundamentally work.\n\nIn this stage you should always be growing.\nThe graph should start with an exponential growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. If your users already have a product that they're comfortable with, how do you get them to switch?\n**Ans. ** Find the moments, when you're product is much more different from their original product. E.g. If you had a party and you needed the place to be cleaned the next day, you would advertise the next day cleaning part. That's when they start using it with the initial product and start to realize how your solution is better.\n\"These are the 50 ways we're better than product X!\" is harder to sell rather than a few points that clearly differentiate yourself.\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec04/","title":"How to Start a Startup - Lecture 4 Notes"},"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec05/":{"body":"I'm taking down notes for Sam Altman's class, How to Start a Startup and I figured I'd start sharing them.

It has all the books in the world. It's online, there are things on it that you couldn't do before.\nGradually expand to different kinds of ecommerce.\nExample:\nEbay started selling pez dispensers -&gt; beanie babies -&gt; auctioning of different kinds of goods.\n\nCounter Intuitive: these companies started in markets so small, that people don't think that they're valuable when they get started.\n\nExample:\nPayPal started with power sellers on ebay. It was a small market of people selling junk on the internet.\nStart big and then shrink\n\nClean tech bubble companies started in big markets\nYou have tons of competitors and you don't even now who your competitors are\nYou DO NOT want to be the 4th online pet food company, or the 10th solar panel company, etc.\nLarge existing markets are very hard to get into\n\nLast mover advantage\nCharacteristics of monopolies:\n\n\nProprietary Technology\n\n\nNetwork Effects\n\n\nEconomics of scale\n\n\nBranding\n\n\nAll happy companies are different because they are doing something very unique.\n\n\nAll unhappy companies are alike because they fail to escape the sameness i.e. competition.\n\n\nHave a technology that is an order of magnitude better than the next best thing.\n\nA very powerful improvement in a key dimension\nSomething completely new is an infinite improvement better\nTLDR; get a massive delta over the next best thing\n\n\n\nBranding:\n\nIt can create great value, hard to invest in companies that work only in branding.\n\n\n\nYou want to be the \"last mover\", the last company in that category\n\ne.g. Microsoft was the last software company (for a long time)\ne.g. Google was the last search engine\n\n\n\nValue in these companies exist far in the future.\n\n\nNote: SV seems to overvalue growth rates and undervalues durability.\n\n\n(Chess analogy about being the last player)\n\n\nHistory of innovation\n\n\nInnovation can become extremely valuable and often the creators/inventors do not get rewarded for this.\n\nThis happens because X and Y are independent\n\n\n\nHistory of science shows: Y = 0%\n\nScientists are often deluded into thinking that they live in a just universe and will be rewarded for their work and inventions\n\n\n\nE.g. (Einstein) smartest physicist of the 20th century, you come up with general relativity, you don't get to be a billionaire/millionaire.\n\n\nTwo broad categories of people who have come up with new ideas and made money off of it:\n\nVertically integrated complex monopolies (e.g. Ford, Standard Oil).\n\nKey to Elon Musk's Space X and Tesla is this structure\nThere was no single massive breakthrough in technology, but integrating all the pieces together (better than competitors).\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychology of competition\n\n\nWe think of the losers as people who can't compete.\n\n\nWe need to rethink this thinking:\n\nWe don't always understand this monopoly competition dicotomy intellectually\nPeople lie about it (see above)\nThere's also a psychological blindspot\n\nWe find it reassuring if other people are doing things\nMimetic preferences\n\n\nWe think of competition as a form a validation\n\n\n\n\"Don't always go through the tiny little door that everyone is trying to rush through, maybe go around the corner and go through the vast gate that no one is taking.\"\n\n\nQ. Monopolies and perfect competition often look similar. How do you easily tell the difference?\nAns. Ask the question: what is the actual market?\nQ. Which of the aspects of monopolies that you mentioned, do you think software companies like Google excel at?\nAns. They have network effects, they had the proprietary technology that gave them the initial page rank algorithm which was an order of magnitude better. They had the economies of scale with the need to store all these sites. So Google basically had all four.\nQ. undistinguishable question\nAns. Palantir started with the intelligence market that used a very different approach.\nQ. What do you think about lean startups, iterative thinking where you get feedback from people vs complexity that may not work?\nAns. Personally sceptical of all lean startup methodologies. The really great companies did something more of a quantum improvement that really differentiated them from everybody else. Typically, did not do massive surveys.\nIf you take enough time to figure out what people want, you most often will have missed the boat by then.\nQ. If you were someone who worked at a high paying company for 6 months, left to Stanford in comp sci. How would you recommend rethinking .. (undistinguishable bit)\nAns. There isn't any easy psychological formula to avoid it. Never under-estimate how big the problem really is.\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec05/","title":"How to Start a Startup - Lecture 5 Notes"},"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec07/":{"body":"\nEDIT: Sorry these are late!\n\nI'm taking down notes for Sam Altman's class, How to Start a Startup and I figured I'd start sharing them. This is for the seventh lecture with the following notes:\nMaking Products Users Love\n\n\nHow do we make things that have a passionate user base.\n\n\nOur users are unconditionally want it to be successful: the products, and the company behind it.\n\n\nGrowth is the interaction between Conversion and Churn.\n\nGap between indicate how fast you're going to grow.\n\n\n\nPhilosophy: To get a billion dollars, focus on what it takes to get that first user and the rest will fall into place.\n\n\nAt Wufoo they compared how does real relationships work and how do we apply them to how we run our business.\n\nThen, build our product that way.\n\n\n\nHuman beings always create a way to anthropomorphize things that we interact with over and over again.\n\n\nFirst time interactions means that the threshold is lower.\n\nUsers though, discover many other moments which they call first impressions later on which they make memorable.\nLinks, advertising, customer support emails, etc.\ni.e. \"opportunities to seduce\"\n\n\n\nJudging quality uses two different concepts that we get from the Japanese:\n\natarimae hinshitsu\n\nTaking for granted quality (functionality).\n\n\nmiryokuteki hinshitsu\n\nEnchanting quality.\nExample: A pen - if the weight of the pen. the ink flowing from the pen and the writing from the pen are pleasurable to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n(slides of applications that take opportunities to put a smile on a users face when you know who your user is. Example: Your trial has expired. Everything works exactly the same but everything is written using Comic Sans)\n\n\nSubscribe to Little Big Details.\n\n\nMarriage problems (even in strong relationships) always fight about the same things.\n\n\nThese things are remarkably similar to company problems:\nMarriageCompanyCustomer Support\nMoneyCost/BillingWebsite visitor\nKidsUsers' ClientsSignup to Trial\nSexPerformanceLogin to account\nTimeRoadmapActive Users\nOthersOthersPaying Users\nStaying Users\n\n\n\nThink of each of these in terms of customer support.\n\n\nCustomer support is the thing that happens in-between each step.\n\n\nThere's a big problem how every company builds up their engineering teams.\n\nSoftware engineers and designers are often divorced from the consequences of their actions.\n\n\n\nBefore launch, everything you do is \"correct\".\n\n\nAfter launch, new tasks start to crop up:\n\nCustomer Support\nFixing crap\nBusiness crap\nHiring crap\nCrap\n\n\n\nWhat we need to do is change software development to inject new values:\n\nResponsibility\nAccountability\nHumility\nModesty\n\n\n\nWe needed a new model to follow: Support Driven Development (SDD)\n\nSDD is another Agile development form\nYou don't need scrum, post-it notes, etc.\nYou just need everyone to do Customer Support.\n\nThis fixes the feedback loop!\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul English from Kayak thought of this as well:\n\n\"Why would you pay engineers $120K a year to do something that you can pay other people a fraction of to handle?\"\n\"After the second or third time the phone rings and they get the same problem. They stop what they're doing, they fix the bug, and we stop getting calls about it.\"\n\n\n\nAgain, like marriage there are four warning signs that show you're about to break up (The Four Horsemen).\nMarriage\nCriticism\nContempt\nDefensiveness\nStonewalling\n\n\n\nAt Wufoo:\n\n+500,000 users\n~5 million people using Wufoo forms and reports\n~400 issues\n+800 emails\n7-12 minutes for response time\n\n\n\nThis format of SDD was carried all they way up to this scale.\n\n\nAt Wufoo, they added a drop down to add your emotional state at the time.\n\nPeople filled this out a similar percentage of time that they filled out \"Browser Type\"\nWhat we can learn from this is: people feel that knowing their emotional state is just as important as all the technical details you need to know how to debug it.\nNote: People didn't try to game the system.\nThis let them know how much people cared about the issue they were filling out.\nWhen communicating over written text, there are only three ways to express emotions: exclamation marks, curse words, all-caps.\nBy metrics, all three of those ways had gone down as people talked to the customer support.\n\"Once people had a simple outlet for their emotion, they behaved a lot more rational and made our jobs a lot more pleasant as a result.\"\n\n\n\nAnother by-product of this is that you actually build better software by doing this.\n\n\nThere's a direct correlation between the time spent with users, and how good our design gets.\n\n\nIt has to come in a specific way otherwise your software will get worse over time:\n\nDirect Exposure: It can't be by someone who generates a report, or a graph. You have to be interacting with them somewhat real-time.\nMinimum of every six weeks.\nAt least two hours.\n\n\n\nIf you want your users to gain knowledge of your product:\n\nYou make your app more intuitive.\nYou increase your user's knowledge.\n\n\n\nAs engineers, we always think: we need more features, this means increasing the knowledge gap. So we need a better way to support our customers to increase their knowledge of your app.\n\n\nGrowth is a function of Conversion and Churn.\n\n\nWufoo paid no money on advertising, marketing, etc. All of it was done through word of mouth.\n\n\nRelationships Atrophy\n\nWhen it comes to relationships, it tends to work like second law of thermodynamics: In a closed energy system, things tend to run down. So you have to constantly have to be putting energy back into it.\nThe typical way to show we care: blog, newsletters.\nWufoo created a new tool that showed all the new features that were implemented since their users' last login - \"Since You've Been Gone.\"\nEvery friday, the Wufoo team who get together and send out hand-written postcards to their users. This added an element of humility back into the cycle.\nThe discipline of market leaders can only be achieved by three ways. You have to organize your company in a very specific way.\n\nBest price\nBest product\nBest overall solution\n\n\nThe third one the only one that can be done at any stage in your company and requires almost no amount of money, just some humility and manners.\n\nQ. What do you when you have a product that a lot of types of users, some users will love one thing, and others will love another?\nAns. Focus on those who are most passionate. Whatever niche it's going to be.\nQ. How do we balance between working on product but all the other skills are also needed by marketing?\nAns. If you're working with product, you should always have this flip side where you're talking to users. Within Wufoo, we just made everyone talk to customers. Working on product must go with talking to your customers.\nQ. How do you make a decision on product and how do you communicate that with engineering teamw when there are a lot of different dirrections to go?\nAns. When you're working with support, you can tell what people had the most amount of problems with or are asking you all the time.\nQ. Tell the story how you came up with the \"king for a day\" at Wufoo.\nAns. I don't like hackathons that are done inside companies. Instead at Wufoo, they came up with \"King for a day\":\n\nSomeone from within the company got randomly drawn, and the \"king\" could tell everyone else what to do on the product. Everything that was bothering them about the company, a feature, could be worked on. Wufoo would do this one or two times a year during a weekend. This ended up being a huge moral boost.\n\nQ. WFH, how did that not end up being a nightware?\nAns. We would allow anyone to work from anywhere, but usually as we tried to recruit them usually ended up wanting to work there anyway. Remote working is tricky. An office gives you a lot of benefits and efficiencies that you now have to compensate for. But remote working has it's own benefits: I don't have to worry about my employees losing two hours to commuting. Thus, we had to respect people's time.\nAt Wufoo, they had a 4.5 days for working. The 0.5 day was for meetings, and then you have the first day which was for customer support. So we have a firm belief that if you have a three day work week, you can finish whatever you need to work on, and you have to respect that persons three day work time to get their work done.\nYou couldn't work for issues that took longer than 15 mins of that persons time. 95% of the time, people would just sleep on it and they ended up saying, \"Oh! We've solved it!\".\nAlso, we were an extremely disciplined company and not many YC companies have been able to replicate what we've wanted to do.\nQ. As the leader of the team, how did you manage to setup accountability as a manager?\nAns. At Wufoo, we had profit sharing. They split up bonuses on how much people managed to do that they set out to, and how well they did in customer support. The simplest way to setup accountability was to create To-Do lists for each person. Everyone can see all the things you want to be done, here are the things you wanted to complete during the previous week, what are your problems at hand? They set the tone for how they want to be assessed.\nQ. How do you hire people that can work remotely and work in this sort of fashion?\nAns. Have them work on a side-project for you as a contractor remotely. You get a good sense of how people managed them selves. Second, we had to screen them for their ability to do customer support. Interview would ask you how to write break up letters to you.\nQ. With all these tricks to help with the company, do you have any that didn't work out?\nAns. We tried to motivate people during crunch time. We want to build a company vacation to reward the employees. So if the vacation is build into the crunch mode schedule. The first crunch mode was just between the co-founders. We each drew up a 10 item to-do list. The first person who got through 7 of the items would win and choose the next vacation location, and the last person would become the trip-bitch (you carried the other peoples luggage and get them drinks, etc.). During that period, one of the guys poorly estimated the items on his list and decided just to give up. So crunch mode just became blah-mode.\n\nWritten with StackEdit.\n\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec07/","title":"How to Start a Startup - Lecture 7 Notes"},"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec09/":{"body":"I'm taking down notes for Sam Altman's class, How to Start a Startup and I figured I'd start sharing them. This is for the ninth lecture with the following notes:\nHow to Raise Money\nInitial Questions\nQ. What makes you want to invest in a founder/company?\nRon:\n\nIs this person a leader? Are they focused?\nWhat made you decide to invent this?\nWhat are you communication skills to lead a team?\nYou have to be able to say in one sentence what your product does. Practice saying this over and over again.\nKeep making decisions - procrastination is the devil.\nBootstrap as long as you possibly can.\n\nMarc:\n\nVC is a game about outliers\n\nIt's about investing in the extreme/edge cases.\n\n\nYou look for the basic check offs: initial customers, launching, etc.\n\nYou also look for the special something that pushes them on the top.\n\n\n\"Be so good that they can't ignore you.\"\nRaising VC is easier than recruiting, viral growth, etc.\n\nParker:\n\n\"Be the Twitter guys.\"\nIf you get in a situation where raising VC is hard, you're going to have much more after this.\n\nQ. What do you wish founders did differently?\nMarc:\n\nRisk &amp; raising cash\nRisk &amp; spending cash\nState your milestones and your risks\nCalibrate the money you raised and spent to the amount of risks you're removing from the business.\n\nRon:\n\nDon't ask people to sign an NDA\n\nYou're saying you don't have trust at the beginning\n\n\nDo it as fast and efficiently as your can\nDon't get your ego in the way\n\nGet it over and done with fast so you can get back to building your product.\n\n\nWhen someone makes a commitment to you:\n\nWrite and email to them to confirm what they just said to you.\ni.e. GET IT IN WRITING.\n\n\n\nQ. Tactics - how does the process go? Can people email you directly? Do they need to give an introduction? How many meetings does it take for you to make a decision? How do you figure out what the right terms are? When can a founder ask you for a cheque?\nRon:\n\nSV Angel: invests in seed stage investments.\n\nOne company for every 30 they look at.\n~1 company a week.\nNow we take leads from within their network.\nThe SV Angel teams even vote to make a first phone call to you.\n\nIf there's a phone call, they're well on their way to invest.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarc:\n\nAndreessen Horowitz: series A stage investing\n\nTop (serious) investors invest in companies if they've already raised at the seed stage.\n\nDo this first before you get to series A.\n\n\nRarely do they go straight to series A without a seed stage (usually only with someone who has been successful before and/or they have worked with in the past).\n~2000 referrals a year through their own network.\nThe best way to get through, is therefore through the referral network.\n\n\n\nQ. What terms should founders care most about?\nParker:\n\nPicking the right seed investors.\nGet a good introduction from someone that VC trusts and respects - higher chance of success.\nYC is a good place where they tell you who those people are.\n\nQ. How should founders negotiate? How do figure out what are the terms?\nParker:\n\nStarted initial evaluation too high (11 million). People started to say it was too high.\nSlowly lowering it down (9 million) hit a threshold that investors were fine with (this varies).\nAbove the level is crazy, and you should just focus on getting the money that you need, not more than you need.\n\nQ. Is there a maximum amount of the company you think founders should sell in their seed round/series A?\nParker:\n\nRoughly 20-30% or 10-15% also seems to work as well.\nVCs are more ownership focused rather than price focused.\nAbove 30% makes it hard for everyone at the table to get around.\n\nRon:\n\nAsk yourself, at what point is my ownership starting to demotivate me?\nIf 40% is gone, you may have just doomed yourself.\n\nQ. Could you tell the story of the most successful investment you've ever made and how that came to happen?\nRon:\n\nInvestment in Google.\nCame across via a party from David Sheraton who knew of the project happening in Stanford.\n\nMarc:\n\nInvestment in Airbnb.\nWasn't an early investment by Andreessen Horowitz.\nHeard that the customer behaviour showed them that it wasn't a terrible idea.\nThey were impressed with the behaviour of the founders and how they were growing.\n\"All three founders were as good as the other founder.\"\n\nRon:\n\n\"In the case of Google, two founders.. one was a little better than the other one.\" &lt;- Ouch!\n\"When you start a company, you have to go find somebody as good or better than you to be the co-founder.\"\nThe anomaly is Facebook/Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nYou have to find phenomenal co-founders.\n\n\n\nAudience questions\nQ. Does raising money help you with an exit or an empire?\nRon:\n\nIf you pick good investors with domain expertise, they will have more value than money. Look for those people.\n\nMarc:\n\nYes, but it doesn't matter.\nYou can't plan these things by the downside.\nIt shouldn't enter the decision if you should raise money. It should depending on which investor you want to raise from.\n\nQ. What should founders do for capital intensive companies to still ... (cannot identify)\nMarc:\n\nThe more capital you have, the more intense you have to be on what is going to be required to make the business work.\nYou have to raise as precise of the amount that you need.\nIf you have viral growth, that's easy.\nIf you have a great idea, but it needs more to get to that point, they will still fund you, but the operational excellence from the team matters a lot more. It's very easy to lose the company.\n\nQ. What is a sign that you should avoid from a particular investor?\nRon:\n\nIf an investor has no domain expertise in your company.\nDoesn't have a rolodex to help you with introductions for business development and series A funding.\nEspecially if they're in it just to make money.\n\nMarc:\n\nThese are people who you will (potentially) be spending the next 10-15 years working with.\nThese are people you need to trust during periods of great stress and anxiety.\nEveryone needs to have the same shared goal, ethics, staying power during the storms that come up.\nIt's like getting married because the relationship is almost as long.\n\nRon:\n\nSV Angel invests for life.\n\nParker:\n\nDo you feel like you respect these people? Do you feel like you have a lot to learn from them?\n\nQ. What are the constraint on how many companies you invest in?\nRon:\n\nIt's really the number of companies. SV Angel just likes 1 a week.\nConflict policy between two investments: only applies when one company morphed into another ones space. They will disclose it to both companies.\n\nMarc:\n\nBiggest constraint is opportunity cost.\n\nThe cost that they're worried about is ruling out conflicting companies. (e.g. Investing in MySpace removes us from Facebook).\n\n\nTime and bandwidth of the general partners.\n\nThere's a limited number of space that each partner has to offer. Once each partner is maxed out, you can't make any more investments (you just don't have the people resources for it).\nEvery investment they make in a company, takes them one spot out of investing in another. Reduces the ability of the company to make new deals.\nPass out based on the relative set.\n\n\n\nQ. What convinces you to invest in a company with no product or no traction?\nRon:\n\nWhat usually convinces them: the founder and the team. The product tends to morph a lot.\n\nMarc:\n\nAlmost always someone they know with a good track record.\n\nQ. Can you talk about the idea of board structure?\nParker:\n\nHaving a co-founder and partner from your investor to help remove the fear someone will fire you.\nIf you trust the people you are working with, it hardly ever comes to a board vote unless something is already deeply broken already.\nLess of a big deal people make it out to be.\nYou almost always have unlimited power on the decision.\n\nMarc:\n\nIn all his 20 years, he's never been in a board vote that mattered. The decision has almost always been unanimous.\n\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec09/","title":"How to Start a Startup - Lecture 9 Notes"},"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec10/":{"body":"I'm taking down notes for Sam Altman's class, How to Start a Startup and I figured I'd start sharing them. This is for the tenth lecture with the following notes:\nBuilding Culture\nWhat is Company Culture?\n\nEveryday (a) and (b) for each member of the team in pursuit of our company (c).\n\n(a) = assumptions, beliefs, values, core values\n(b) = behaviours, actions\n(c) = goals, bhag (big hairy audacious goal), mission.\n\n\n\nWhy is matters?\n\n\nFirst Principles that you go back to when you make decisions.\n\n\nAlignment people to values that matter to the company.\n\n\nStability to fall back on.\n\n\nTrust each other with.\n\n\nExclusion\n\n\nRetention\n\n\nIt takes time to come up with a set of culture values that the company believes in.\n\n\nTook a year to ask employees what core values they wanted and bring it down to 10.\n\n\nEveryone says we want honest, service, team work, etc.\n\n\nInstil the idea that it's company first, department, team and then yourself.\n\n\nElements of high performing teams\n\nTrust you can actually have debates if you have conflict and debate.\nConflict if you don't have conflict and debate, it's just the blind leading the blind\nCommitment people are not willing to commit then.\nAccountability people are not held accountable to things they committed to\nResults you can't get results then.\n\nBest practices\n\nIncorporate your mission to your values\nPerforamnce - think harder, deeper, longer\nInterview for culture fit (!)\nEvaluate performance on culture\nMake it a daily habit - if you don't you eventually stop doing it and the company slowly dies\n\nQ/A with Brian (Airbnb)\nQ. The process by which you came to realize that culture was important?\nAns.\n\nAirbnb was supposed to be the idea to pay the rent to think of the big idea.\nWe were lucky to have a team that were up to your level (see lecture 9 notes).\nFounders are like parents\n\nThe company is the children: it's up to the \"parents\" to set the right attitude.\nYou would want your child to endure and out live you.\n\n\nCore values learned:\n\nBehaviours that change over time\nSome principles that never change.\n\n\n\nQ. How long did it take you to hire your first employee?\nAns.\n\nFirst employee was the first engineer.\nInterviewed for 4 months.\nYour first engineer was bringing in DNA to your company\n\nThere would be a 1000 people like this person.\nDo I want to work with 1000 of this kind of people\nYou want diversity of backgrounds, age, etc.\n\nYou don't want diversity of values\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. What are Airbnb's values?\nAns.\n\nChampion the mission - we want to hire people for the mission.\nBe creative &amp; frugal\n(better to watch this bit with the stories)\n\nQ. How does having a story culture helped you make strong decisions?\nAns.\nThree things no one tells you about culture:\n\nNo one ever tells you about culture\nIt's hard to measure\nIt doesn't pay off in the short-term\n\n\nInterview for World Class &amp; they fit the culture.\n\nQ. Culture and brand were two sides of the same coin. Talk about branding for a bit.\nAns.\n\nThere's no such thing as a good or bad culture. A culture that's good for someone doesn't necessarily have to be a good culture for you.\nBrand is the connection between you and customers. If you have a really strong culture, the brand will come through.\n\nQ. How did you communicate what Airbnb does in the early days?\nAns.\n\nEarly days, we communicated like a utility - it's a cheap alternative to hotels.\n\nThis under-cut the ideas.\n\n\nDid a lot of story telling.\nArticulate the vision over and over again.\n\nQ. How do we make sure the hosts are re-enforcing the culture of Airbnb?\nAns.\n\nLate to realizing this, but are gradually re-inforcing this in every step of the way.\nBad hosts were seriously affecting the business.\nHosts are partners. Had to get hosts that believed in this same values.\nThe super-host program gives them extra support and stuff.\n\nQ. Airbnb has made contributions to the open source community. Thoughts on how that contributes to the thoughts around the development team?\nAns.\n\nWe try to be a generally open culture.\nStrong identification of the team.\n\nEvery company needed a mote that protects from your competition.\nWanted to be better technology. Changed this to be giving the best experience in the world instead.\n\n\nThe engineers (with those same strong culture values) independently decided this was a thing they should do.\n\nQ. There weren't that many visitors to the site when trying to get off the ground. How did you get users to the site?\nAns.\n\n(Not about culture)\n\"It's better to have 100 people who love you, than to have a million people that just kinda sorta like you.\" - PG\nTo get 100 people to love you, you need to do things that don't scale.\nLiving with your users and spending time with them.\nGiving them attention to the point that they were really passionate.\nA lot of things were done manually for the users.\nUntil they knew exactly what the perfect service was, only then did they create the tools and technology to do it.\n\nQ. A lot of people think Airbnb is more of a marketing company? Thoughts?\nAns.\n\nHave to work with a lot of things like people's ACTUAL security since there are people sleeping in their hosts' sheets.\nCountries that need to be convinced that this is a good thing for them.\nMatching the right people with the right hosts.\nThese are just a few of the things that they have to do, so it would be wrong to call them a marketing company.\n\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec10/","title":"How to Start a Startup - Lecture 10 Notes"},"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec13/":{"body":"I'm taking down notes for Sam Altman's class, How to Start a Startup and I figured I'd start sharing them.

Silicon Valley is suboptimal for plans where you want to rent a 20 storey building full of sales people. Groupon was required to be in Chicago which is good at this.\n\n\nWhat kinds of startups would someone be an idiot to do in SV?\n\ne.g. Designing a fashion company. Great idea, but there isn't a good network for it here!\n\n\n\nShould I be a contrarian?\n\n(A contrarian is a person who takes up a contrary position, a person who seems to be \"contrary for the sake of being contrary,\")\nIts hard to be contrarian and right.\nHow does a smart person actually disagree with me?\nA really good contrarian idea: what would smart people (in that field) think is a good idea.\nIn general, as a founder, it's good to be a contrarian.\n\n\n\nDelegation\n\nShould I do the work or delegate the work?\n\nIn truth: both\n\n\nShould I be recruiting people?\nSometimes one at 100% or the other at 100%\n\nFlexibility\n\nShould I be flexible or persistent?\n\nAgain: both\n\n\nYou get opinions from both ends of the spectrum on how to do this.\nHave an investment thesis (possibly contrarian) on why you think is potentially a good idea.\n\nShould include what you know that others don't know\nDo I have an increase in confidence or decreasing?\n\n\nIf increasing, stay on track, be persistent\nIf decreasing, you don't have to necessarily jump out\n\nWhat do we do to fix this?

(!)\n\n\nQuestions\nQ. How did you stick with a strategy to get your investment thesis?\nAns.\n\nThe problems in 2003 were different from what we have now. They (LinkedIn) sent out invitations to different people, and got PR to get people.\nNow, how are you competing for potential customers?\nWhat is the hack that I know that others don't?\n\n\nQ. How do you know if someone is a good founder or not?\nAns.\n\nI'm a believer of references\nOnly meet with people through a reference\nIt's a way to sort out time\nNetwork is really key\n\n\nQ. Density of insight is a strong signal for great founders. Being able to distil a thesis into a concise sentence.\nAns.\n\nThe ability to be coherent on what you're targetting.\nNOT a Swiss army knife approach\nFounders who have analyzed the problem in a good way\nFounders who do not have a good analysis, but have an instinct on what they're doing\n\n\nQ. What kept you going with persistence (RE: LinkedIn)?\nAns.\n\nBelieving the right economic system design was to have a public professional profile\nIt may not have taken off the speed that we want\nIt takes us longer to get there, but that's okay\n\n\nQ. When you get a founder that you think is going to be good. What makes you get wrong about someone who looks good at first observation?\nAns.\n\nConviction in the person when they're trying to reason with you is what you look for in a founder\nSometimes you find people who have learned to mimic that behaviour. They look like they're thinking about the challenges that you're bringing up but they're actually ignoring you.\nAdaptability questions\nIs there an ego issue that might get in the way\n\n\nQ. Co-founding team, how to evaluate how to be co-founders?\nAns.\n\nSerious trust\nPeople say don't invest in a husband-wife team (since personal dynamics can affect)\nYou should ask: do they collaborate well? Do they help each other get to truth?\nAdjusting to what is the truth (i.e. people who work off each other)\n\n\nQ. Different founder, different areas. How do you identify them?\nAns.\n\nThis talk is about, what is unique to all founders as a whole (not specifically technology).\nInvestors try to understand a domain so they cam better invest in that domain.\nEach domain has a set of attributes in that domain.\n\n\nQ. How do you know when to stay in longer than expected? Or when do you pivot?\nAns.\n\nThe part of the reason of having an investment thesis (IT)\nIf your confidence in IT is decreasing for a very long time:\n\nYou've gone into intense mode to see what could do to increase confidence\nWhen THAT starts failing, then you should consider pivoting.\n\n\nA frequent mistake: wait till everything has crashed into the wall. You waited way too long!\nFounders have no balance\n\nWhile you are working on this thing, you cannot remain balanced. It is 100% of you that goes into it.\n(This isn't forever, but maybe for a couple of years before you go off to do other things)\n\n\n\n\nQ. How good is the startup eco-system in identifying contrarian opportunities?\nAns.\n\nMixed.\nGenerally, the system is good at it.\n\n\nQ. What you do think about creating markets vs. covering them?\nAns.\n\nWhat would lead you to believe what would be a market there or not?\nWhat is it that you think you know that others don't know.\n\n\nQ. When do you know someone long enough to ask someone to be their co-founder?\nAns.\n\nIt's one of the risks that you take\nYou're going to spend 20+ hours with this person, do you feel comfortable doing that?\nHave a set of robust conversations with this person that you can later bring up (re-iterating trust)\n\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec13/","title":"How to Start a Startup - Lecture 13 Notes"},"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/htsas-lec14/":{"body":"I'm taking down notes for Sam Altman's class, How to Start a Startup and I figured I'd start sharing them.

Force yourself to simply everything you do!\n\n\nAsk clarifying questions.\n\n\"Did you mean this?\"\n\"Where is our competitive advantage here?\"\n\n\nAllocate resources\n\nThe goal is to use less red ink everyday.\n\nIt's okay if you're having a bad day, but your red ink should reduce every month/quarter\n\n\n\n\nEnsure consistent voice\n\nNot as intuitive to most people\nYour PR release/packaging/recruiting page should all sound like it was written by one person.\nInitially, you can do it all yourself. Over time, you want others to do this.\nAlmost every company has one piece that isn't under the same voice.\n\n\nDelegate\n\nYou shouldn't be doing most of the work. The way to get out of doing the work is to delegate.\nThe problem: you're actually responsible for everything.\nAbdicate vs. Micromanagement requires you to use Task-Relevant Maturity\n\nAny one executive/CEO shouldn't have one management style. Management style needs to be dictated by the employee.\nDifferent people require varying amounts of management. Some require micro-management.\nHow do you make decisions? (Delegate vs. doing it yourself)\nDelegate when you have a low confidence in your own opinion.\n\nLet people make mistakes, so they can learn.\nLetting your employees making mistakes teaches them the mistake, but it allows them to be excited about their job and how to filter their ideas.\n\n\nIf your conviction is high, you can't let your employee make a mistake. (You're ultimately responsible for that mistake).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrels &amp; Ammunition\n\n(Barrels referring to gun barrels)\nMost great people in companies are \"ammunition\"\nWhat you really need in your company are barrels\n\nYou can only shoot though the number of unique barrels you have\n\n\nBarrels are incredibly difficult to find\n\nWhen you do, promote them, give them equity (Don't lose them!)\n\n\nA barrel in one company is not always a barrel at another company\nA barrel can take an idea from conception all the way to shipping and bring people to them\n\nHow do you figure out who is a barrel?\n\nStart by giving them very simple responsibilities\nKeep expanding the scope of their responsibilities until they break\nEveryone will break. Everyone has some level of complexity that they can handle\nSome people will surprise you, so you have to keep testing the envelope to see what that point is for everyone\n(!) Once you've hired someone, (in an open office) watch who goes up to other peoples desk.

This is for the fifteenth lecture with the following notes:\nHow to Manage\nOne Management Concept\n\nWhen making a critical decision, you must understand how it will be interpreted from each person's point of view and its impact on the union of the individual views (i.e. culture).\n\nDemotions\nAs a founder/CEO\n\nIt's tough to fire someone who has put in a big effort.\nA demotion is a \"have your cake and eat it too\" scenario.\n\nWin-win\n\n\nNo cultural backlash.\n\nAs an executive\n\nMay not want the demotion, but it gives them an option.\n\nIt's better than being fired.\nEasier to explain to a new employer.\n\n\nEnables them to keep growing with the company even though they're demoted.\n\nFor everyone else\n\nDoes he keep his same equity package?\nIs he going to work as hard being the guy who reports to that guy?\nDo I have any respect for him now that he's been demoted?\n\nRaises\n\nExcellent employee asks for a raise\n\nAs a founder/CEO\n\nYou want to retain them.\nThey have done great work, so it's \"fair\".\nThey will like you if you give them the raise and you want to be liked.\n\nOther employees\n\n\nUnfair that I didn't get a raise.\n\n\nI did better work, so doubly unfair.\n\nMaybe that means, you're not evaluating people on their performance. You're giving the raise to the first person that asks.\n\n\n\nMaybe I should quit.\n\n\nCultural Conclusion:\n\nEvery employee has a fiduciary responsibility to heir family to ask for a raise all the time.\n\n\n\nRight Answer\n\nYou have to be formal about the performance evaluation process.\n\nYou can't say, we want it to be organic and a natural experience.\n\n\nAll the right inputs.\nRun as frequently as needed.\nNo raises outside of the process.\n\nYou can't give raises when asked.\n\n\nMakes the employees feel they are getting a fair chance.\n\nThey don't have to play golf with you in order to get a raise.\n\n\n\nEvaluating a Sam Altman blog post\n\" Most employees only have 90 days after they leave a job to exercise their options. Unfortunately, this requires money to cover the strike price and the tax bill due for the year of exercise (which is calculated on the difference between the strike and the current FMV). This is often more cash than an employee has, and so the employee often has to choose between walking away from vested options he or she can't afford to exercise, or being locked into staying at the company. It's a particularly bad situation when an employee gets terminated.\nThis doesn't seem fair. The best solution I have heard is from Adam D'Angelo at Quora. The idea is to grant options that are exercisable for 10 years from the grant date, which should cover nearly all cases (i.e. the company will probably either go public, get acquired, or die in that time frame, and so either the employee will have the liquidity to exercise or it won't matter.) There are some tricky issues around this-for example, the options will automatically convert from ISOs to NSOs 3 months after employment terminates (if applicable) but it's still far better than just losing the assets. I think this is a policy all startups should adopt. \" -sama\n\nIs Sam right?\nHow stock option package works in startups:\n\nYou get stock that vests over a period of time.\nWhen you leave the company, you have 90 days to buy your stock options before it's gone.\nThis has been a \"rule\" since the 80s.\n\n\nHistory:\n\nYour perspective\n\nWant to be fair.\nDon't want employees to stay who don't want to be there, but feel handcuffed.\nWant to reward people who stay.\n\nPerspective of the employee who leaves\n\nI worked for my shares; I shouldn't be prevented from getting them due to economics.\nDid you tell me the truth when you hired me? If you didn't, I'll make sure that everyone knows that.\nIf I was fired, I just got screwed a second time.\n\nPerspective of the employees who stays\n\nIs it smarter for me to stay or leave?\n\nYour employees know each other better, than they know you.\nShould I have left too?\nHow does that compare to my deal?\n\n\nAre my colleagues being treated fairly?\nDoes my loyalty matter?\n\nSituation Analysis\n\nCompanies lose employees in Slicon Valley at around 10% per year.\nSV companies dilute at 6-8% per year when they are private for employee group.\nIf an employee doesn't exercise their stock during the exercise period, it goes back into the pool where it can be reissued to new or existing employees.\nLosing all your stock is a big financial incentive to stay.\nA 10 year option on a highly volatile security is quite valuable.\nWhen the employee goes to the new company, she gets the new company stock plus the 10 year option.\nThe employee who stays gets the option only.\n\nTwo Alternative Cultural Statements\n\nWe treat new employees with the utmost straight-forwardness and fairness and we will therefore give you 10 years to exercise your stock if you quit or are fired.\nWe'll tell you up front: you are guaranteed to get your salary. For your stock to be meaningful, you must either:\n\nVest\nStay until we exit or have the cash to exercise\nMake the company worth something (10% of nothing is nothing)\n\n\nWe do this because we massively value those who see it through and will minimize the dilutive cost of those who leave.\nThere should be more incentive to stay.\n\nHistory's greatest practitioner\n\nTouissaint L'Overture\n\nBorn a slave\nMost brutal form of African slavery (now known as Haiti)\nVision:\n\nEnd slavery\nTake control of Haiti\nMake it a first class country\n\n\n\n\n\nConquering the enemy\n\nQuestion: What do you do with the defeated leaders?\nHe had to take into consideration everyone's POV:\n\nHis soldier's\nHis enemy's\nThe culture\n\nWhat kind of country was he trying to build?\nHe didn't allow his soldiers to rape or for them to cheat on their wives.

When people ask about my last internship at Snowplow Analytics, they're always surprised and asking the same question, \"Really? A remote internship? How does that work?\". I wanted to write this down to show others what I've learned from my first remote work experience.\nPyjamas were not my only work clothing\nYes, it's true at first that since you're working from home, you don't physcally interact with people much, so you don't have to dress up in any specific way. I started my day by waking up and then watch YouTube videos or read some news sites for a bit. Then pivot straight to opening my work environment and begin checking my email. An hour and a half later, I'd realize I hadn't eaten yet, so I'd go do that then clean up and get back at it until lunch. Some times I'd go straight from bed to emails until lunch (while snacking) to actually getting myself cleaned up. All of this was fun to do at first, just because I couldn't.\n\n\n\nI learned the hard way that I started to become sluggish, grumpy and affected my lifestyle. The first few hours of my day I'd get very little done, I'd half sleep and use the computer (since my workspace was also my bedroom). Everything done during that time was barely productive that I'd need to work extra later on to get some value out of the day. The longer hours further worsened my day.\nI was lucky enough to notice this early on before it started to become a habt. I fixed my schedule by acting like I was going to leave to go work (i.e. breakfast, shower, dress up) but finally head back to my desk, all propped up, and sit down like I just reached. This was a major change in my current routine. Productivity increased, lifestyle, and general happiness.\nCoffee shops are your friend\nOne of the problems with always working remotely is that you spend majority of your time alone. I love working in silence wth just the sound of some musc or TV in the background; loud enough to hear, not loud enough to pay attention to. As humans though, we're natually social beings so it's necessary to get out and interact with others; even being in a social atmosphere. You're working remotely and in most situations (like mine), it meant that you only need a computer and nothing else.\nI decided to try out working half a day in a coffee shop, and I found out that I'm just as productive (and sometimes even more) when at a coffee shop. It seemed like being in a social atmosphere seemed to make me focus on my work since there were fewer distractions there than my house which let me fool around and relax too much. This became into a mini-ritual that I would follow: if I needed carefully designed code, grab my laptop head to a coffee shop. It seems odd to rationalize, but this setup worked probably because I zone out everything around, and begin focusing on the task in from of me.\nTravel in the weekends\nI later realized that I could work ANY WHERE I wanted! So I used this opportunity to travel around Canada to places I hadn't been to yet. One weekend that included bank holidays, I hopped on a plane to Vancouver and visited some friends there. We went hiking and visited the city all weekend, then on the next work day, I would work in the evenings in order to be on the same time zone as the rest of the team.\n\n\n\nI hit Montreal as well for the Osheaga Music Festival on another weekend!\n\n\n\nConclusion\nDon't be afraid to try to get out and go different places, you're not limited to just your desk at home. If you were, there wouldn't be much difference from working in an office. Also a shout out to Alex and Yali for giving me this internship in the first place that let me do this.

Ironically, I had to use one at work and though I despised it at first, I tried to keep an open mind about it. Which seems to have made all the difference because I can't seem to not use one. I'm not even talking about what BlackBerry 10 is now, I mean during the BBOS times.\nNow the other side of that coin is that during the period of hate, I loved the idea of Android (and still do to some extent) being open, easy to use, free to develop on, etc. What's there to hate?\nMy recent annoyance with it, is that it isn't dependable. It's fragmented, the OS is still left to manufacturers to update (Nexus devices excluded), and if the updates don't make it, you're pretty much left on your own. I've gone through an HTC Desire to a Galaxy Nexus and they were both great phones in their day and age, but I couldn't help but notice how quickly they degraded to being slow and useless within a time frame of a year at most.\nAnywho, the point being: I wanted speed, support and spoons (because I can't think of another word starting with 'S').\nIn order to make my switch, I took a good look at my Q10 and Galaxy Nexus to weigh them out equally to see if it was even remotely possible to make the switch over.\nI started off by comprising a list of apps that I had on my Galaxy Nexus that I couldn't live without:\n\nEvernote\nEmail account support\nWhatsApp\nGoogle Authenticator\nIngress\nText messaging backups to Gmail\nCamera picture sync\n\nEvernote and email account support was easy since Evernote support is built into the notes application that comes with the phone and email support... do I really need to explain this part? It's a BlackBerry, it was made for email.\nWhatsApp: I don't really use as much, but it's available in the BlackBerry app store.\nGoogle Authenticator is an app I use almost religiously for two-factor authentication of my Google account, SSH login, Evernote, anything else you fancy that needs that level of authentication. The problem was that once you have your account setup on Google Authenticator for your Android, you can't get that setup code again.\nFair enough, but I was sure I could figure this out. First I needed the application to begin with. I was able to get that from apk2bar.org and sideload it onto my device fairly easily.\nOn my Galaxy Nexus, I logged into an adb shell and swooped around for the application data files. After perusing the internet as well, I found that the secret key is stored in a sqlite file in /data/data/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/databases/databases \nI downloaded the file to my computer and opened it up in sqlite3 to retrieve the key:\n\n\nYou can now use that secret key that you can add on your other Google Authenticator. You can also use the 'Move to a different phone' option in your Google Account settings to move your account, but I wasn't too happy with that option when I found out that it would break all your existing applications specific passwords that you had given access.\nFor camera picture syncing that wasn't too hard as well since this features seems to be supported using Box (which also gives you 50GB of online storage while signing up), but what I really wanted was to have it sync Dropbox. Once again, I went the help of the built-in Android Player and I was able to use the Android version of Dropbox to sync all those cat pictures from my phone to a (safe?) remote location.\nText Message sync took a bit more googling, but I eventually came across an application called SyncLion which has almost all the features SMS Backup+ currently has. Since not all apps can run as a service, it lacks the fine feature of auto-sync which I adore oh-so-much. When this comes, it will be well worth the $2.99 it currently costs on BB World.\nAlas, Ingress is the only application I can't get on my Q10! Ingress is an augmented reality, location based game created by Google. It's more interesting to play it than to explain so I'll leave that up to you to research.\nThe problems with trying to sideload the android app is that the Android Player doesn't support Google account APIs, for legal reasons I pressume. Authenticating using your Google account is the only way to go about it, so for now I'm stuck..\nRefs: How-To Geek\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/moving-from-android-to-blackberry-10/","title":"Moving from Android to BlackBerry 10"},"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/setting-up-owncloud/":{"body":"I've been looking for a way to remotely access my media securely using ownCloud but I could never get myself to sit down and do it. Turns out that it's a bit of a hurdle on Mac OS because it isn't officially supported.\nSetting up the web server\nIn Mountain Lion, Apple remove the option to easily start a web server from System Preferences -&gt; Sharing. So instead we have to do it via Terminal.app, which if fine since we can setup a few more things from there as well.\nFirst check where the server's root directory starts in:\n\n\nI preferred to change this to `/Library/WebServer/Sites` to make it more consistent, but I'll only refer to the default one in this post.\nUncomment the line php5_module in the /etc/apache2/httpd.conf to enable php5 since ownCloud requires it.

You want to move the '/owncloud' directory to your DocumentRoot location /Library/WebServer/Documents.\nGive the apache webserver the right ownership to the owncloud directory:\n\n\nYou also need to create a `.htaccess` file at the DocumentRoot location with:\n\n\nIf all went well, you should now be able to setup an administrator account in ownCloud from your browser with `http://localhost/owncloud`. \n*Note: During the setup, you should change the data folder to another location under Advanced for security.

I found out that you can do that by installing the ownCloud app External storage support.\nThen in the admin settings, setup a folder from there with the 'Configuration' field as the absolute path to the directory you want. When done, a green circle will show up, to confirm if the folder is accessible.\n\nAccessing via SSH\nIf you're behind a firewall or a local network, this web server won't be accessible past your LAN (which is how I wanted it). For those instances where I did want to access it remotely, I wanted to do so over SSH which makes me feel a bit safer.\nYou can enable SSH from System Preferences -&gt; Sharing -&gt; Check \"Remote Login\" and port forward that from your router if needed. If you need help port forwarding, this is a generic solution that should work for most.\nAlso, consider changing the default SSH port to something other that port 22 to avoid random attacks at your IP address. Check out this serverfault question on how to do that.\nOpen an SSH tunnel to your remote ownCloud server like so:\n\n\nThis tunnels all traffic from your remote port 80 to your local port 5900.

It's just easy and simple - choose a host name, host size, server location, base OS image and optional SSH keys if you don't want to use a password.\n\n\nEDIT:\nI decided to install Gitlab after all, so I manually installed gitlab to my server but it seemed to severly slow it down. Instead, I created a new Droplet with the One-Click Install Image for Gitlab (for some reason this version is less memory intensive), and then moved all my configuration/setup to the new Droplet.\n\n\nAlso I moved the gitlab instance from running at '/' to '/gitlab' instead.\nWith v6.6 it was pretty easy with the documentation within the configuration. You basically have to make four changes:\n\n\n\nIn your application.rb file: config.relative_url_root = \"/gitlab\"\nIn your gitlab.yml file: relative_url_root: /gitlab\nIn your unicorn.rb: ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] = \"/gitlab\"\nIn ../gitlab-shell/config.yml: gitlab_url: \"http://127.0.0.1/gitlab\"\nIn lib/support/nginx/gitlab : do not use asset gzipping, remove block starting with \"location ~ ^/(assets)/\"\n\n\n\nUpdate First\nI chose my base image as Ubuntu 12.04 x64 being an LTS, I find it much nicer to use. First things first, I SSH'd in and apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade to make sure everything was up-to-date.\nDocker\nI'm learning more about deployment using docker so I had that installed as well. It's worth mentioning that DO has a BETA feature when creating your Droplet with pre-installing applications like Docker, Ghost or GitLab. However, I prefer doing this myself so I know exactly what is installed. I followed the Docker installation guide for Ubuntu 12.04, but I skipped updating the kernel since the base image was already using kernel 3.8.x.\nPrivate VPN\nI always wanted to have access to all my boxes at all times, and DO has a nice simple guide to setting up a PPTP VPN on your server to allow connected clients to communicate with each other. You can find the article here.\n\nIf you want to run your traffic through any one of your other clients (and they also have an SSH server running on them), I've found using sshuttle really easy for that.\n\n\nWhen connected via VPN you can use sshuttle --dns -r [PPTP_IP_ADDRESS] 0/0 to have your traffic including your DNS go through the client of your choice. It's helpful if you have clients in different countries and need local web access for whatever reason.\n\nSub-domain\nWhen you create your droplet, you're given an external IP that you can use to remote in, but no one wants to remember that. Since I have my domains managed with namecheap.com I chose to manage this server as a domain through that instead of DO's own nameservers.\nThe blurred out bit in the image below, is where you would enter your external IP address and the sub domain is up to you.\n\nGit\nThis was probably the easiest bit, just install git: apt-get install git git-core.\nEverything was going to do be done as a private repo for now so it would be behind SSH and I didn't care for having a web interface for it. You can find more details on settings up a git server correctly, but essentially all you need to do is:\n\n\nClients would add the remote as:\n\nConfiguring clients\nMost Linux OSes come with a PPTP client installed so setting that up is quite trivial.\nI created a few SSH configurations so I can type less:\n\n\nAs well as a few aliases in my `.bashrc` that looked something like this:\n\nSwap File\nIf you're using the 512MB RAM configuration, it's also wise to setup a swap file since you will inevitably run into low memory issues very soon. DO have yet another very handy tutorial on how to do exactly that.\nConclusion\nIf you found any of this useful and you're going to join DigitalOcean as well, why not use my referral link instead. :)\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/setting-up-private-server-digital-ocean/","title":"Setting up my private server on DigitalOcean"},"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/ubuntu-14-04-without-unity-launcher/":{"body":"Ubuntu 14.04 LTS recently launched so I decided to give it a spin on a spare SSD I had (I'm not a fan of desktop VMs).

In essence, he talks about how we have a terrible routine where we are always surrounded by \"grey noise\" which blocks us for actually doing work.\nThis puts me in an odd place because I feel exactly as how he described the office space, a place where you go to not get work done because we're constantly travelling there, bothered by others at work, or distracted by a broad range of things.\nI recently finished an internship at BlackBerry and I'm fairly pleased with what I've accomplished in the past 8 months. A background of the work culture needs to be understood before I can go any further. \nAt this time, the company isn't in the best financial standing as it was only a few years ago having lost massive amounts of the North American ecosystem to competitors. One of the reasons this may have been, because of the slow release cycle that was followed all these years that come to getting a major release out the door. Since then, they've moved to an agile work flow, i.e. fewer meetings, more development. ReadWrite has a nice article about enterprise needing to change to this model. This change is still a work in progress so it's a half implemented development process which leaves you wanting more. You still get the feeling there are places in the company that don't like the idea of working how you please as long as you get the job done. Maybe it's years of having developed the habit of working from 9 to 5. This may work in some companies, but software development is definitely not one of them. \nKeeping this in mind, I tried to follow as little as possible of the norm, with the sole idea of getting things done even if it meant bothering people daily. I'm not a moron, I wouldn't be pushy if I knew someone was working on something more important. You can easily see over time who those people are, and who aren't. Even through the short time of my internship I felt the pattern settling in where I would slow down and follow a laid back schedule. This may have been because I started realizing my internship was coming to an end, but there was more to it than that, since I was fully aware of this being an issue, I chose to forget the days and not focus on the time left. Luckily, I was in one of the teams that were open to a flexible work timings and giving you, the developer, more control on what to do. This made a huge difference as well on how I would work. Instead of working on what others thought were more important, I was able to fix bugs that I felt required more time.\nAnother interesting observation I came across was while I was sick. I was too sickly to get to work (which takes about a hour just going there), so I decided to work at home. I was staying at my parent's place and the entire house was empty since everyone else had gone to work. I sent the occasional email from my phone while still in bed with one eye barely open and then went back to sleep. Later on, I cleaned myself up and since there wasn't anything urgent I launched Steam and started an early afternoon DotA game while my work laptop was starting up and settings up my environment. I was amazed at how many bug fixes and early feature implementations I was able to accomplish at such an extraordinary speed. Having no one around, gave me a pressure-free work environment. I screwed around for some time, grabbed a snack every now and then without annoying others with my Cookie Monster styled eating habits. The point I'm trying to get at, is that I wouldn't be able to get half of what I accomplished that day than I would have if I was at work. I would constantly need to get up for something or the other, which breaks your entire focus. It just all feels like a waste of time. I'm not trying to say that everyone should work at home and we'd all be better off, but the work environment should be similar to one that doesn't come with the extra baggage and stress.\nYou start to think of the what your ideal work place would be, and I don't even have anything concrete thought up yet. What I do know is it shouldn't be a hassle to get there, work timings and mandatory meetings shouldn't exist, and what ever else management can think up should be ignored. Dan Pink mentioned in a TED Talk that Atlassian started a program called Fedex Days (renamed to ShipIt Days) to help their employees motivate themselves and come up with something new. He has a similar take on this as well.\nComing out of this, I still feel I could have accomplished more with the right mindset. BlackBerry was an amazing work experience and I would definitely consider going back there. This post is mainly a reminder for myself that I can always do better, and that the feeling of lazy satisfaction is what will slow me down. Also, like Aaron mentioned, I should start blogging more, just to keep myself in check - a reminder to learn something new and then confirm it, but writing down what I learned.\nI'll be going back to university again come January and there'll be a time where I try realize that I'd prefer this work schedule rather than what I'll have then.\nRelated link: No Managers: Why We Removed Bosses at Treehouse\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/archive/working-in-a-post-waterfall-company/","title":"Working in a post-waterfall development company"},"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/":{"body":"","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/","title":""},"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/browser-keyboard-shortcuts-mozilla-mobile/":{"body":"Firefox has support for keyword search in the address bar, which is handy during development at Mozilla.

It's a minimalistic Debian Wheezy based distribution that doesn't waste any of your time setting up your computer and lets you get to what you want to do.\nIt's hardly resource hungry as well. From a cold a boot it uses ~400MB of RAM.\nI spent the best part the day setting up everything to be the way I like it. So I thought I'd at least put it somewhere for reference later on.\nConky\nThe first thing I saw when I booted my laptop was conky - time to get a neat looking conky script to show off those stats. I settled for a conky script that I found on the #! forums. There are plenty more on the forum, but I found this one more to my liking. You can download the conkyrc file here and the lua file here.\n\nMy T420s needed a special fan controller with a configuration which is handled by thinkfan.\nAdaptive screen colour correction\nI came across a nifty application called f.lux that essentially corrects the colours of your screen to be 'warmer' as the day moves towards the end. The idea behind it is to not allow you get tired from staring at your screen all day. Which in turn, would cause irregular sleep patterns. While flux works perfectly on CrunchBang, I prefer to use it's alternative Redshift for linux OSes and f.lux for Windows/Mac. To be honest, the only reason I do this is because I think the f.lux icon looks out-of-place on most linux window managers - personal preference really. Not to mention that redshift already exists in the repositories, so a simple sudo apt-get install redshift solves all your problems. The help pages explain how to use it, but I set redshift to 5000 in ~/.config/openbox/autostart so that it's enabled on boot: redshift -O 5000\nSublime Text 2 (Text Editor)\nI'm a big fan of Sublime Text, so this is a must on any computer I use.

Should be easy enough?\nWriting the part for capturing flags wasn't that hard, but there were many options available so it took a while to ponder on what I needed and while purpose suit me. I've seen implementations where people use simple if statements for dot files as so:\n\nSure, that works, but not exactly for my needs since I have multiple flags to handle. Which lead me to getopts. Using getopts was a bit fancy, but when you realize how easy it is to implement you'll learn to love it. I'm not going to repeat what Ricardo Salveti has done quite well in his blog here, but after reading it, this was my implementation:\n\nIn a nutshell, it's a while statement with cases. The \"bf:\" says that only a flag '-b' needs to be entered by the user, '-f' has a semicolon after it to indicate that it's expecting a value with the flag, similar to writing foo.sh -f my_value_here.\nThe beauty of getopts is that it can handle the same flag multiple times. If you would do that with the current code about it wouldn't spit out any errors, but it wouldn't work as expected. Lets say you wanted to use the '-f' flag twice. The value of MYOPTF would be the value of last -f value used and no other. This can be solved with a small modification:\n\nThat should work fine since you have a list of all the values, you can easily iterate through it with a for loop.\nThe disadvantage (as far as my use case is concerned) with getopts is that it only accepts single character flags so you couldn't use flags like --help which the gnu styled arguments and is a bit unfortunate.\nI finally decided to use a hybrid of all the information I put together since I ran into the case where I needed to accept either option '-h' or --help:\n\nYou would have noticed I threw in a bunch of stuff that I didn't mention previously, and that's sort of the assumption I made.\nWhat I've essentially done in while [ ! $# -eq 0 ] is I've said, while the number of arguments are not zero, do so and so.\nThe $1 is the first argument that's passed the script at execution, to avoid having to write cases for $2, $3, etc. I \"shift\" the argument off my list once I'm done processing it through my case statements, and then repeat while arguments exist.\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/different-ways-to-implement-flags-in-bash/","title":"Different ways to implement flags in bash"},"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/embedding-video-in-jekyll/":{"body":"The code:\nYoutube embedded code works just as fine in Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/embedding-video-in-jekyll/","title":"Embedding video in Jekyll"},"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/erlang/":{"body":"\nI wrote this a while back in November 2017 while learning Erlang even earlier in February, but I’ve finally got around to posting it. It may contain some outdated information.\n\nThis is long overdue on my experiences learning Erlang. It was also my first introduction to functional programming. I’ve written this as an experienced developer learning new concepts so there are probably many implicit assumptions made.\nWhy learn Erlang?\nI had been meaning to learn a functional language after a long time of interest. In a way, I probably felt that I was letting myself down by not challenging myself enough; a fear of fear.\nBrowsing Hacker News I came across a comment that mentioned a class to learn Erlang that was starting soon on Future Learn. Thankfully it wasn’t one of those 7 month long courses, taking three-fourth of your focus from daily life and expect you remember what you did the previous week when you can’t even remember where you left your socks the previous day. A meagre 3 weeks seemed like a perfect length for me to plow through.\nFor some background, I’ve come from a fair experience dabbling in C++, Python &amp; Rust in my university years, and now a career in Android development. This made me feel confident in my knowledge on imperative programming to learn something new.\nErlang’s background also intrigued me. I’ve found sanity in learning languages that have stood the test of time and still remained relevant. Being the language of choice for what built WhatsApp was an additional plus - a small team able to scale to such a size of users sparked interest in a side of me that once cared deeply about distributed systems.\nIt must be said that Simon Thompson, Professor of Logic and Computation in Computing at the University of Kent, did an exceptional job of breaking down the classes to the right amount for more intermediate students. What previously bored me about other MOOCs were their need to assume everyone was coming from a beginner level, losing interest in their more experienced users because of slow momentum. I was happy to see Simon skip over unnecessary explanations with fair assumptions on student’s prior knowledge.\nWhat I liked in Erlang\nImmutable bindings and immutable data structures felt like a hinderance to my brain at first, similar to having a thought and not being able to change it. The first week was a bit painful for me to unlearn a lot of concepts I didn’t realise I had implicitly relied on and grew to love. Eventually this made sense.\nTail Recursion\nIt was the first thing I remember clicking in my head that felt like I had unlocked a side of my brain I never knew existed, constantly walking past it, assuming it was just a wall. I can’t tell how how refreshing it felt that all parties in a function were always known then-and-there in the arity itself.\nTo explain in a little detail, Erlang is a language where everything is immutable and for-loops do not exist. The only way to loop is through a combination of recursive calls and function argument pattern matching.\n\nThis is your usual naive example of writing a Fibonacci sequence that will add to the call stack. We can do better by approaching the problem similar to how one would when writing a memoized version, from 0 to N, but in the Erlang case we can store the previous two Fibonacci values in the function argument itself, so that there is on state left behind. Not having a recursive call take up space on the call stack didn’t take long to understand when the rest sunk in. Instead,  it pushes that said state, into the argument of the next call, allowing the VM to reuse the same function but with new inputs (the second call). This is how I understood tail recursion.\n\nWhat we’re doing here is counting upwards from fib(1) and fib(0), putting the  values of the previous two calls in the last two arguments of fib/3 and reducing  N until we reach 0. When we do, we know what the Fibonacci of that number is.\nPattern Matching &amp; Unpacking\nIt’s better to explain both of these two together given how well they compliment each other.\nI’ve worked on Rust for a bit prior with some smaller projects using pattern matching, but I didn’t find the language (or maybe the documentation material?) enough for me to have the same “ah-ha” moment that I did have with Erlang.\nIn most other languages, pattern matching stops at a “case” or “switch” level. Consider an argument or return value and match it against all possible combinations that you would like to handle. With Erlang, pattern matching existed at the function level, where you could call a function by the arguments or argument structure it had. To better explain what I’m probably failing to say..\n\nIf f(0) is called, it returns the atom zero otherwise, anything else is returned back; a fairly trivial example.\n\nNote: I failed to originally explain that an atom is another data type that exists in Erlang. It doesn’t hold data, but is mostly used as an identifier for your data.\n\n\nHere, we’re going one step further. We match the function f against a tuple of two values. More over, the first pattern match is looking for the first argument to be the atom zero.\nTake a minute to consider what we’ve just done. We checked to see we were given a non-empty tuple, a tuple with two values, a tuple with the first argument an atom, and held the second argument in a variable A.  Consider doing this in a different language where you would have to explicitly check each and every case before we were able to get to our actual logic (* coughJava 6 cough *).\nThis becomes even more powerful with Erlang’s list accessors for the head, tail and equality testing.\n\nWe just did something quite amazing that I’m certain I’ll fail to properly convey: a list can be defined as a head on the left of the vertical bar; the tail to the right. With the equality to the List, we’ve said that the bindings of A and B should satisfy that of List. What would happen is that if A and B were already bound, their values should be that of what is in List, if they were not bound, they will now have that binding. If that were to fail, it would throw an exception.\nIf that made sense to you, feel free to sit back and feel those quarks materialise in a Higgs-Boson field. Sorry, I won’t do this again..\n\nNote: “guards” should also be given some merit to where we can also make assertions.\n\nMessage Passing and Processes\nMy instinctual thoughts when I learnt that Erlang’s RPC methods were about asynchronous handing and overhead but I didn’t have to worry about it. Erlang threads, from what I understand, are some what similar to green threads with various scheduling differences that are beyond me. Spawning process as I pleased was also foreign to me, being able to send messages to it and have them do what ever I wanted felt too easy - it felt wrong coming from an Android world. I still struggle to get myself to use processes to do things in the background, but I suspect it’ll eventually becoming second nature.\nOTP\nSadly, I have even less to say about OTP given my limited knowledge of it. I would really like to have another course that would focus more on it. That said, learning some of the basics of gen_server and playing with gen_tcp have shown me how brilliant it is to avoid writing a lot of boilerplate code Erlang code (even though it’s already a lot less than you would usually have to write in other languages).\nWhat I didn’t like\nFrom what I understand, some of the later additions to the language were patched on without a more elegant solution compared to the rest of the language. Try/catch blocks seemed like a strange addition to have where we have better ways or error checking already. Records too were a necessity but also fell short - more like an afterthought.\nWhat's Next\nMy hopes are to learn more from OTP. After which, I’d like to see what Elixir has to offer, although I’ve grown quite fond of the world of Erlang.\nI spent some time after the courses to implement a rudimentary WebSocket library in an effort to see what I could put into practice and what sunk in long term.\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/erlang/","title":"Learning Erlang as a seasoned developer"},"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/git-on-mac-os-persistently-uses-http-proxy/":{"body":"So I've been running into the problem off late on Mac OS when using an HTTPS proxy and then using git over https.

I grew up playing football1 and shorter sprints were alright (with heaving between them), but I was never good at running anything more than 200 meters. I  simply don't have the natural talent or endurance compared to other folks that I've run with who seem to have good form without trying, so it's something that I have to work hard at to succeed. I guess that strikes a cord with me somehow.\n\n\nIt helps me think: as part of your typical training, you have to do a \"long run\" which has a longer distance than the other runs during the week. This run gets incrementally longer every week until you reach a 30-34K point. They aren't the type where you are sprinting, instead it's one where you run at a pace that lets you carry out a casual conversation with someone next to you. During my long runs, I try to focus on my breathing and running form so that I can zone out on everything else. At the end of it I feel physically drained, but my mind seems clearer and quieter in some ways.\n\n\nDuring the race, you are running at your \"race pace\" - faster than what you would do during your long runs where you are pushing yourself to work on the limit of what you can sustain for the distance. Around the 30-32K is when the inner demons/voices come out and tell you to stop. You are tired and the mind starts to play tricks on you. It lies to you, telling you the distance is too far, or to just take a break and you can start again2 , or worse it starts telling you that you can't do hard things. So the mental game of fighting them is a therapeutic one for me where it's more a battle of the mind than body.\n\n\nTraining takes months and if you're determined, it forces you to follow a routine which I don't typically have. Making time for your weekly runs amongst your social or work life means evaluating where you can find that time. I hate waking up early in the morning, but that's the best time to get a run in to finish it off before I need to really start my day, and this helps me avoid being lazy and doom-scrolling on my phone in bed.\n\n\nI am healthier and mentally more refreshed after having gone out for even a short run. Getting myself out the door for a procrastinator like myself is a lot, but once I'm done I realize that I wasn't that hard.\n\n\nTypically, once a week you would do a hard session where you repeat intervals at fast paces, the kind you can keep up for a few hundred meters. These are obviously draining, but I feel stronger at the end of an interval session even though it's brutal during it.\n\n\nI didn't know I could enjoy it. I always had various aches and pains after football games or random runs when growing up. Now, I no longer recall how I got into this state, but around  years ago standing on my feet for too long would cause me knee pains on my left leg. A 3K run would leave me bedridden for the next day.\nI was referred to a physio who told me that I was walking with a limp without realizing it, so before I could run I had to learn to walk (ha!). I followed their advice for many weeks and after growing muscles that I wasn't properly using before, I started to go on incrementally longer runs in my neighbourhood and realized that my body didn't hurt at the end of them.\nI was still bad at nutrition mind you, forgetting to eat and hydrate before, but I felt good after it, which was new to me.\n\n\nWhen I train, motivation during the intervals or the long runs are hard to come by for me. After every run, I keep notes about how the run went, what I learnt along the way and what I did to prepare in advance for it. I keep these notes public within my small social circle to try to social engineer myself to believing people are reading it (like this blog!) and expect to see it.\nAdditionally, I like to write down what does or doesn't work because maybe someone else might want to read and learn from it. Everyone's running journey is different, but little hints along the way could help.\nI also want to show that there aren't only good (run) days - I get frustrated and upset at myself because I didn't eat well the night before, stretch before the run, or even forget to take enough water for the distance. It should be normal to see failure along the way, and not just share only the victories in public. It's the bad days that make the good ones matter.\n\n\nFinally, it gives me a sense of accomplishment with an achievable goal that comes with a deadline. It takes months to train for the race where you have a 3-4 month period where you need to run about 4-5 times a week and try to get in 60+km in there. The race ends up feeling like a victory lap of all that effort.\n\n\n\n1\nSoccer.\n\n2\nDon't! Once you stop, the voices start to win and you end up stopping again and again. Unless of course you really are in pain from your physical body. Over time you, maybe during your first couple of races or even your long runs you learn to know the signs of what are really physical pain and which ones are the mental ones.\n\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/marathons/","title":"On marathon training"},"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/migrating-to-zola/":{"body":"I did it - finally restarted this blog! 🙌\nWhy\nI'll keep this short - there are others who are more expressive and have shared their opinion on everything Zola does for them - go read those instead. Here is the shortform for me.\nI found it tedious to maintain a Jekyll site and the various plugins that you needed for what I believe should be the built-in behaviour.\nOn every new machine I used, I found myself using a Docker image for building the Jekyll site locally so I could get the magic combination correct to have it always working, until it eventually didn't work anymore.\nPreserving hard-links\nI started with trying to look out for a way to migrate my existing Jekyll posts while also preserving the hard-links to them. I came across Eugene Baichenko's writings and script which I used and got myself up and running in no time.\nAfter some more research, I learnt that Zola supports aliases which lets you preserve your hard-links without needing to build the directory structure required to keep those links. Those links just redirect to the new Zola ones, which was good enough for my needs.\nPreserving page highlighting\nZola happily seems to support YAML as a frontmatter, so for legacy posts, I didn't need to update the format and instead just include the new properties where needed (e.g. disabling table of contents on certain posts). Along the way, I also learnt that YAML supports references and inheritance - wild stuff.\nExisting syntax highlighting is also preserved and at most, I needed to update the language shortcodes to match Zola's (e.g. objc to m). In miscellaneous posts I seemed to have used Liquid templating, but that too wasn't hard to search-and-replace.\nIncremental migration from Jekyll\nDoing the actual migration required slowly changing things over in my spare time. Starting off the blog in a sub-directory /jonalmeida first to get everything working there. Finally, removing the existing blog from the root directory and moving the contents of /jonalmeida into the root.\nFinal thoughts\nIt seems like most of the audience for Zola are coming from other Static Site Generators.\nI haven't found the Zola documentation to be spectacular so it took me a bit to understand what aliases were and how to use them - I came across the original issue to support aliases which linked to the Hugo docs that eventually told me what I needed to know.\nIn another case, I moved to Zola because I wanted separate feeds for each tag and I couldn't figure out to get this to work even though I had already enabled it with this block:\n\nThis must be my own shortsightedness though, because it seems obvious to others.\nI'm also not complaining too much since this is a community-driven project; happy to see it being used by sites like Fastmail too. All in all though, I'm quite happy with where I've gotten to and I find the Zola and Tera templating combination far less intimidating.\nLet's see where this takes me.\n","id":"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/migrating-to-zola/","title":"Restarting this blog & migrating to Zola"},"https://jonalmeida.com/blog/print-cargo/":{"body":"When writing tests in Cargo, you sometimes need to debug failures and print statements are a great way to do that.
