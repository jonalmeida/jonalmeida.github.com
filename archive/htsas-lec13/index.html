    <p>I'm taking down notes for Sam Altman's class, How to Start a Startup and I figured I'd start sharing them. This is for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ7ZvO5DpIw">thirteenth lecture</a> with the following notes:</p>
<h1 id="how-to-be-a-great-founder">How to be a Great Founder</h1>
<h2 id="perception">Perception</h2>
<ul>
<li>Perception of a founder:
<ul>
<li>Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc.</li>
<li>An image of Superman/Superwoman</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reality:
<ul>
<li>Someone who deals with a lot of problems</li>
<li>No one is generally "superpowered"</li>
<li>You want to have a couple of "superpowers", something that gives you an edge</li>
<li>Although, this is not a function of genius</li>
<li>It's hard to tell the difference between genius/madness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Potential skills of a founder:
<ul>
<li>Founding Team</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Delegation</li>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Vision</li>
<li>Focus</li>
<li>Confidence</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
<li>Risk</li>
<li>Persistence</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Time Horizon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>May seem like a super human task</li>
<li>You don't necessarily want to score 10/10 in all the skills of a founder</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="team">Team</h3>
<ul>
<li>It's usually best to have two/three people as the founders (broad set of skills to spread)</li>
<li>You can compensate with other founders weaknesses</li>
<li>Diversity of problems as a founder, you can go at them from different angles</li>
<li>Have a high degree of trust with those co-founders (see previous lectures for more detail)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="location">Location</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to be successful, I need to go where the strongest networks are where the particular kind of problem that I'm trying to solve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silicon Valley is good for software products (not for all though!)</p>
<ul>
<li>This is due to various off-topic reasons</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>e.g. Groupon needed massive numbers of sales forces. Silicon Valley is suboptimal for plans where you want to rent a 20 storey building full of sales people. Groupon was required to be in Chicago which is good at this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of startups would someone be an idiot to do in SV?</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g. Designing a fashion company. Great idea, but there isn't a good network for it here!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I be a contrarian?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>(A contrarian is a person who takes up a contrary position, a person who seems to be "contrary for the sake of being contrary,")</em></li>
<li>Its hard to be contrarian and right.</li>
<li>How does a smart person actually disagree with me?</li>
<li>A really good contrarian idea: what would smart people (in that field) think is a good idea.</li>
<li>In general, as a founder, it's good to be a contrarian.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="delegation">Delegation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should I do the work or delegate the work?
<ul>
<li>In truth: both</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should I be recruiting people?</li>
<li>Sometimes one at 100% or the other at 100%</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should I be flexible or persistent?
<ul>
<li>Again: both</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You get opinions from both ends of the spectrum on how to do this.</li>
<li>Have an investment thesis (possibly contrarian) on why you think is potentially a good idea.
<ul>
<li>Should include what you know that others don't know</li>
<li>Do I have an increase in confidence or decreasing?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If increasing, stay on track, be persistent</li>
<li>If decreasing, you don't have to necessarily jump out
<ul>
<li>What do we do to fix this? (flexibility)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="confident">Confident</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should I be confident or cautious?
<ul>
<li>Third time: both</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have my vision of how the world should be <strong>BUT</strong> smart enough to listen to criticism, negative feedback, competitive entries.</li>
<li>Is this changing my investment thesis?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="internally">Internally</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should I focus internally or externally?
<ul>
<li>People in the back haven't heard: both</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internally: Build the product, ignore the world, ignore competitors</li>
<li>Externally: Recruiting, meeting people, gathering network intelligence</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vision-or-data">Vision or Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should I work by vision or data?
<ul>
<li>Both</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data: motivated by data, gather the data, be guided by the data</li>
<li><em>Data</em> only exists within the framework of a <em>vision</em> you are building to</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="risk">Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should I take risks or minimize risks?
<ul>
<li>Both</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have to be a risk taker</li>
<li>One of the skillsets you need to build on is, how do I make intelligent risks
<ul>
<li>How do I minimize my other risks with this? (i.e. two birds with one stone)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should I focus on the short term or long term?
<ul>
<li>Both</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jump between the two</li>
<li>Solve the problem that's immediately in front of you</li>
<li>Short term: What do I need to be doing today? Have I made progress today?
<ul>
<li><strong>BUT</strong>, is it largely on path?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-know-if-you-are-a-great-founder">How do you know if you are a Great Founder?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You should have <em>some</em> superpowers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Useful to be a product person (in software especially)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Useful to have leadership and persuading people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognizing whether you're on track or not (am I <em>STILL</em> on track with my thesis?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's no one skillset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's an ability to learn and adapt, and the ability to constantly have a vision that drives you, and take input from all sources and take networks from around you. (!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>Q. <em>How did you stick with a strategy to get your investment thesis?</em></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The problems in 2003 were different from what we have now. They (LinkedIn) sent out invitations to different people, and got PR to get people.</li>
<li>Now, how are you competing for potential customers?</li>
<li>What is the hack that I know that others don't?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Q. <em>How do you know if someone is a good founder or not?</em></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a believer of references</li>
<li>Only meet with people through a reference</li>
<li>It's a way to sort out time</li>
<li>Network is really key</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Q. <em>Density of insight is a strong signal for great founders. Being able to distil a thesis into a concise sentence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to be coherent on what you're targetting.</li>
<li>NOT a Swiss army knife approach</li>
<li>Founders who have analyzed the problem in a good way</li>
<li>Founders who do not have a good analysis, but have an instinct on what they're doing</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Q. <em>What kept you going with persistence (RE: LinkedIn)?</em></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Believing the right economic system design was to have a public professional profile</li>
<li>It may not have taken off the speed that we want</li>
<li>It takes us longer to get there, but that's okay</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Q. <em>When you get a founder that you think is going to be good. What makes you get wrong about someone who looks good at first observation?</em></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conviction in the person when they're trying to reason with you is what you look for in a founder</li>
<li>Sometimes you find people who have learned to mimic that behaviour. They look like they're thinking about the challenges that you're bringing up but they're actually ignoring you.</li>
<li>Adaptability questions</li>
<li>Is there an ego issue that might get in the way</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Q. <em>Co-founding team, how to evaluate how to be co-founders?</em></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Serious trust</li>
<li>People say don't invest in a husband-wife team (since personal dynamics can affect)</li>
<li>You should ask: do they collaborate well? Do they help each other get to truth?</li>
<li>Adjusting to what is the truth (i.e. people who work off each other)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Q. <em>Different founder, different areas. How do you identify them?</em></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This talk is about, what is unique to all founders as a whole (not specifically technology).</li>
<li>Investors try to understand a domain so they cam better invest in that domain.</li>
<li>Each domain has a set of attributes in that domain.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Q. <em>How do you know when to stay in longer than expected? Or when do you pivot?</em></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The part of the reason of having an investment thesis (IT)</li>
<li>If your confidence in IT is decreasing for a very long time:
<ul>
<li>You've gone into intense mode to see what could do to increase confidence</li>
<li>When <em>THAT</em> starts failing, then you should consider pivoting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A frequent mistake: wait till everything has crashed into the wall. You waited way too long!</li>
<li>Founders have no balance
<ul>
<li>While you are working on this thing, you cannot remain balanced. It is 100% of you that goes into it.</li>
<li><em>(This isn't forever, but maybe for a couple of years before you go off to do other things)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Q. <em>How good is the startup eco-system in identifying contrarian opportunities?</em></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mixed.</li>
<li>Generally, the system is good at it.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Q. <em>What you do think about creating markets vs. covering them?</em></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What would lead you to believe what would be a market there or not?</li>
<li>What is it that you think you know that others don't know.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Q. <em>When do you know someone long enough to ask someone to be their co-founder?</em></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It's one of the risks that you take</li>
<li>You're going to spend 20+ hours with this person, do you feel comfortable doing that?</li>
<li>Have a set of robust conversations with this person that you can later bring up (re-iterating trust)</li>
</ul>
