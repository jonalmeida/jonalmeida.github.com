    <p>I'm taking down notes for Sam Altman's class, How to Start a Startup and I figured I'd start sharing them. This is for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWgVWGEuGE">tenth lecture</a> with the following notes:</p>
<h1 id="building-culture">Building Culture</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-company-culture">What is Company Culture?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Everyday <em>(a)</em> and <em>(b)</em> for each member of the team in pursuit of our company <em>(c)</em>.
<ul>
<li>(a) = assumptions, beliefs, values, core values</li>
<li>(b) = behaviours, actions</li>
<li>(c) = goals, bhag (big hairy audacious goal), mission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-is-matters">Why is matters?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>First Principles</strong> that you go back to when you make decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong> people to values that matter to the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stability</strong> to fall back on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trust</strong> each other with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exclusion</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retention</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It takes time to come up with a set of culture values that the company believes in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Took a year to ask employees what core values they wanted and bring it down to 10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone says we want honest, service, team work, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instil the idea that it's company first, department, team and then yourself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="elements-of-high-performing-teams">Elements of high performing teams</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trust</strong> you can actually have debates if you have conflict and debate.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong> if you don't have conflict and debate, it's just the blind leading the blind</li>
<li><strong>Commitment</strong> people are not willing to commit then.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability</strong> people are not held accountable to things they committed to</li>
<li><strong>Results</strong> you can't get results then.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate your mission to your values</li>
<li>Perforamnce - think harder, deeper, longer</li>
<li>Interview for culture fit (!)</li>
<li>Evaluate performance on culture</li>
<li>Make it a daily habit - if you don't you eventually stop doing it and the company slowly dies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="q-a-with-brian-airbnb">Q/A with Brian (Airbnb)</h2>
<h3 id="q-the-process-by-which-you-came-to-realize-that-culture-was-important">Q. The process by which you came to realize that culture was important?</h3>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Airbnb was supposed to be the idea to pay the rent to think of the big idea.</li>
<li>We were lucky to have a team that were up to your level (see lecture 9 notes).</li>
<li>Founders are like parents
<ul>
<li>The company is the children: it's up to the "parents" to set the right attitude.</li>
<li>You would want your child to endure and out live you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core values learned:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Behaviours that change over time</li>
<li>Some principles that never change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-how-long-did-it-take-you-to-hire-your-first-employee">Q. How long did it take you to hire your first employee?</h3>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First employee was the first engineer.</li>
<li>Interviewed for 4 months.</li>
<li>Your first engineer was bringing in DNA to your company
<ul>
<li>There would be a 1000 people like this person.</li>
<li>Do I want to work with 1000 of this kind of people</li>
<li>You want diversity of backgrounds, age, etc.
<ul>
<li><em>You don't want diversity of values</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-what-are-airbnb-s-values">Q. What are Airbnb's values?</h3>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Champion the mission - we want to hire people for the mission.</li>
<li>Be creative &amp; frugal
<em>(better to watch this bit with the stories)</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="q-how-does-having-a-story-culture-helped-you-make-strong-decisions">Q. How does having a story culture helped you make strong decisions?</h3>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong>
Three things no one tells you about culture:</p>
<ol>
<li>No one ever tells you about culture</li>
<li>It's hard to measure</li>
<li>It doesn't pay off in the short-term</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Interview for World Class &amp; they fit the culture.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-culture-and-brand-were-two-sides-of-the-same-coin-talk-about-branding-for-a-bit">Q. Culture and brand were two sides of the same coin. Talk about branding for a bit.</h3>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There's no such thing as a good or bad culture. A culture that's good for someone doesn't necessarily have to be a good culture for you.</li>
<li>Brand is the connection between you and customers. If you have a really strong culture, the brand will come through.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-how-did-you-communicate-what-airbnb-does-in-the-early-days">Q. How did you communicate what Airbnb does in the early days?</h3>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Early days, we communicated like a utility - it's a cheap alternative to hotels.
<ul>
<li>This under-cut the ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did a lot of story telling.</li>
<li>Articulate the vision over and over again.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-how-do-we-make-sure-the-hosts-are-re-enforcing-the-culture-of-airbnb">Q. How do we make sure the hosts are re-enforcing the culture of Airbnb?</h3>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Late to realizing this, but are gradually re-inforcing this in every step of the way.</li>
<li>Bad hosts were seriously affecting the business.</li>
<li>Hosts are partners. Had to get hosts that believed in this same values.</li>
<li>The super-host program gives them extra support and stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-airbnb-has-made-contributions-to-the-open-source-community-thoughts-on-how-that-contributes-to-the-thoughts-around-the-development-team">Q. Airbnb has made contributions to the open source community. Thoughts on how that contributes to the thoughts around the development team?</h3>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We try to be a generally open culture.</li>
<li>Strong identification of the team.
<ul>
<li>Every company needed a mote that protects from your competition.</li>
<li>Wanted to be better technology. Changed this to be giving the best experience in the world instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The engineers (with those same strong culture values) independently decided this was a thing they should do.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-there-weren-t-that-many-visitors-to-the-site-when-trying-to-get-off-the-ground-how-did-you-get-users-to-the-site">Q. There weren't that many visitors to the site when trying to get off the ground. How did you get users to the site?</h3>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Not about culture)</li>
<li>"It's better to have 100 people who love you, than to have a million people that just kinda sorta like you." - PG</li>
<li><strong>To get 100 people to love you, you need to do things that don't scale.</strong></li>
<li>Living with your users and spending time with them.</li>
<li>Giving them attention to the point that they were really passionate.</li>
<li>A lot of things were done manually for the users.</li>
<li>Until they knew exactly what the perfect service was, <em>only then did they create the tools and technology to do it.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-a-lot-of-people-think-airbnb-is-more-of-a-marketing-company-thoughts">Q. A lot of people think Airbnb is more of a marketing company? Thoughts?</h3>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have to work with a lot of things like people's <em>ACTUAL</em> security since there are people sleeping in their hosts' sheets.</li>
<li>Countries that need to be convinced that this is a good thing for them.</li>
<li>Matching the right people with the right hosts.</li>
<li>These are just a few of the things that they have to do, so it would be wrong to call them a marketing company.</li>
</ul>
