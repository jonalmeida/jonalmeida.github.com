title: Linux command-linx completion is hard to live without

I've started using my hackintosh for development of late, and I noticed that I struggle to use Terminal.app because it seems to lack the full tab-autocomplete features that linux seems to have. For those that don't know, when you start to type something in a terminaI, you press tab, and it'll spit out a list of options that start with what you've typed in. I never realized how addictive it was to have on my linux computers.

It's crazy how much time it saves me and how useful it is as a search tool so I thought I'd make a list of the common functions I use with I can't live without anymore.<br>
*Note: In the screenshots below, I've pressed tab at the end of each line I've written to have the options show up, you just can't see me type it obviously.*
### Finding packages with \<insert package manager here\>

### Searching files in a directory

### Application support for command-line arguments
I'm not sure if this one is relevant or it's part of the OS, but I'm talking about auto-completing `git comm` into `git commit`

To some, this might seem like a ridiculous thing to mention, but I come across people who forget that there's an extra button on your keyboard that's hiding next to your left hand when you type, and (in a small way) it can add to your productivity.
