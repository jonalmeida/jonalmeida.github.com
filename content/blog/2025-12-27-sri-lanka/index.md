We travelled to Colombo, Sri Lanka for the first time this year and it felt like a lost opportunity that we didn't do that more often when we lived closer in that region. It was a quick trip to explore but also catch up with friends who moved there years ago.

Some notable observations:
 - So much greenery! My inner pessimist expected a city of this size to have removed it all for urban growth, but I was happy it wasn't so.
 - We noticed there was an organized service of people wearing green t-shirts that kept the city clean of fallen leaves and litter. Local shops also seemed conscious about keeping the areas around their stalls or shops proper.
 - "Hidden technology" is the term I use for modern software or hardware that is helpful for everyday people but not in your face constantly - the inverse example of that would be touchscreens on self-serve machines that make accessibility difficult (e.g. vending machines). Colombo appeared to have some of this going for it with apps for rickshaws or easy payment options everywhere.
 - Sri Lankans come off as kind people. We were frequently mistaken for locals (until we started speaking) so we probably didn't get the tourist treatment all the time. I thought found it pleasant that there was some sense of religious equality there - you could find a Hindu temple, Muslim mosque, and a Catholic church all practically on the same street and everyone seemed to live happily together.

It was a short visit and of course not everything is peachy, but I prefer focusing on the positives and potentials. Sri Lanka felt like a dilapidated version of Japan in an affectionate way that has a more people-first approach to development.
