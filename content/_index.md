# Scribblings and nonsense

<!-- I'm a software enginer that has worked on various Android projects for a while now. If you'd like to <a href="https://mindly.social/@jonalmeida" target="_blank">follow me on Mastodon</a>, I don't always post about tech things. -->

Hi there! I'm a Software Developer that mostly works on mobile projects at Mozilla. You're honestly better off contacting me <a href="mailto:hello at my domain">directly</a> if you'd like to chat about something I've <a href="/resume.pdf">worked on</a> in the past.

Have a look at some of my posts about things I've learned, talked about, or other miscellaneous notes. You may find a few grammatical or syntactical errors. If you let me know about them, I'll get it fixed.
