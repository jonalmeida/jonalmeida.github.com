A small portfolio look at the work I did from a UI prespective since I do not have publically available code to show for it.

The main Notification Settings page controls global settings with specific logic for changing the Notification mode.

![Main page][main]<br>

Each Application page was created from a single template page which queried and retrieved settings. Settings that didn't exist didn't show up in the UI along with special product requirement tweaks.

![Application page][app]<br>

The Application list mapped applications with settings with translated Application names from Navigator (Launcher).

![Application list page][list]<br>

The 'Learn More' links were dynamically created page showing helpful text depending on your current application settings and the global settings page.
