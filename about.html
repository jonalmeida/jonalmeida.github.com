  <p>I'm a Software Developer after completing my Computer Science degree where I work on smaller projects.
  You're honestly better off contacting me <a href="mailto:hello at my domain">directly</a>, or check out <a href="/resume.pdf">my resume</a> if you're looking for something specific.

  Have a look at some of my posts about things I've learned, talked about, or other miscellaneous notes. You may find a few grammatical or syntactical errors. If you let me know about them, I'll get it fixed.
