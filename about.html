  <p>I'm a Software Developer that works on mostly mobile projects at Mozilla. You're honestly better off contacting me <a href="mailto:hello at my domain">directly</a> if you'd like to chat on something I've <a href="/resume.pdf">worked on</a> in the past.
  <p>
  Have a look at some of my posts about things I've learned, talked about, or other miscellaneous notes. You may find a few grammatical or syntactical errors. If you let me know about them, I'll get it fixed.
