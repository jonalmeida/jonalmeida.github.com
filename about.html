  <p>Software Developer and Student, currently working on smaller projects while finishing my Computer Science degree at the University of Windsor.
  You're honestly better off contacting me <a href="mailto:hello at my domain">directly</a>, or check out <a href="/resume">my resume</a> if you're looking for something specific.

  Have a look at some of my posts about things I've learned, talked about, or other miscellaneous notes. I sometimes write when I'm incredibly tired and don't even realize, so you may find odd statements or a few grammatical errors. If you let me know about them, I'll get it fixed, deal?

  All thoughts are my own blah blah blah.</p>
